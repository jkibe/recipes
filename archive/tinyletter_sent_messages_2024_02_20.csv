"Confinement Cooking, Week Four","<div>Hello dear readers, and welcome to the first edition of my confinement cooking newsletter.<br/>
<br/>
Based on the subscribers list as I compose this, my first letter is going to have a pretty limited audience.&nbsp;I&#39;m not trying to turn myself into a food celebrity. But I&#39;d love to know if you&#39;re enjoying this, and I&#39;d strongly encourage you to plug this to all your friends. I&#39;m not above admitting that having an audience helps keep me motivated. Not that I have all that much else to do with my time.<br/>
<br/>
For now, this isn&#39;t&nbsp;meant to be trendy meal plan-style set of recommendations with a shopping list. If you&#39;re looking for me to lay out a plan for your life, there are tons of people doing that elsewhere.&nbsp;I&#39;m hoping a slightly looser approach can still be interesting.<br/>
<br/>
For the past few weeks I&#39;ve been doing soups for lunch. They&#39;re easy to make in advance, and I appreciate the minimal cognitive requirements of mindless reheating.&nbsp;This week,&nbsp;I&#39;m doing something new and something true.<br/>
<br/>
On the experimental side, I&#39;m trying out <a href=""https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/curried-lentil-tomato-and-coconut-soup"">this recipe for a curried lentil and coconut soup</a> from the always wonderful Yotam Ottolenghi. Miraculously I was able to find dried black beans on my latest supply run, so I&#39;m&nbsp;alternating&nbsp;with a basic <a href=""https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/1773-black-bean-soup"">black bean soup</a>. Both can be made vegetarian, possibly even vegan. I&#39;m not devout enough for that. I made chicken stock with leftovers a couple of weeks ago, and plan to savor every drop.<br/>
<br/>
These soups would not be complete without some&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmRaU9RSl3E"">bread</a>, which I&#39;m continuing to make with my own sourdough starter.&nbsp;It also makes great toast with butter and jam for breakfast.<br/>
<br/>
For dinner, I&#39;m planning to try out <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/B-mF9DRpz2J/"">a recipe for Chinese-style steamed buns</a> (bao) from Taku Sekine, who made his reputation at&nbsp;Dersou in Paris.&nbsp;I&#39;ve tried making bao before, and have yet to succeed. Perhaps confinement&nbsp;cooking will save me.<br/>
<br/>
After an unintentionally Italian week last week, I thought I&#39;d do something French. I had it in my head to make salmon with a warm lentil salad. Except that my local Whole Foods was out of green lentils. So instead, I&#39;m going a little further south and planning to do salmon with a shaved fennel salad.<br/>
<br/>
And to use up the dregs of a couple of bottles of white wine, I bought some frozen shellfish &mdash; a secret weapon, confinement or not &mdash; and plan to&nbsp;toss together a seafood risotto.<br/>
<br/>
Eating at home is no reason not to have some sweet treats as well. I still have some leftover hot cross buns from Good Friday. Once those are exhausted, I&#39;m thinking of making the <a href=""http://www.charlottepuckette.com/recipes/savory-tarts-and-quick-breads-recipes/rye-cocoa-cake/"">rye cocoa cake</a> from <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Poilâne-Secrets-World-Famous-Bread-Bakery/dp/132881078X"">the new Poil&acirc;ne cookbook</a>. It sounds like a slightly ludicrous flavor pairing, but something about the slight sour tang of the rye flour really goes well with the mellow darkness of the chocolate.<br/>
<br/>
Cooking only for myself, I&#39;ll probably&nbsp;alternate these dishes according to my mood. If you&#39;re looking for another meal idea, I love Tom Kerridge&#39;s <a href=""https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/lush_lemon_pepper_19156"">recipe for lemon pepper chicken with potatoes</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Until next week,<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week Five","Welcome to another week of confinement cooking.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s very exciting: this fun newsletter has crossed into a double-digit number of subscribers! I&#39;ll keep going regardless, but I&#39;d still encourage you to tell your friends to sign up too.<br/>
<br/>
Before we consider my plan for the week ahead, a bit of reflection on the week before.<br/>
<br/>
Most of what I made was familiar repertoire. I can make risotto in my sleep. There was one notable challenge: the <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/B-mF9DRpz2J/"">bao</a>. How difficult could it be? Pretty difficult. Not to the point that I failed completely. But there&#39;s a lot to learn. It reminds me of trying to bake bread. Superficially, it&#39;s so simple, but doing it well depends so much on mastering so many tiny details.<br/>
<br/>
My other experiment &mdash; the Ottolenghi red lentil-coconut soup &mdash; was more of a success. It would have looked better with a verdant hit of cilantro. Alas, I forgot to buy it when I did my weekly shop. I&#39;m also too much of a wimp for quantity of red pepper flakes he suggests. The piquancy aside, it&#39;s definitely a recipe that&#39;s going to enter my repertoire.<br/>
<br/>
Moving to the week ahead, I&#39;m trying to at least eat like it&#39;s spring, even if I&#39;m not entirely sure how to execute that in the kitchen, and I can&#39;t meaningfully go outside and enjoy the spring weather.<br/>
<br/>
After over a month eating nothing but soup for lunch, I&#39;ve decided it&#39;s time for a change. Something about fennel feels vernal. Perhaps the color. In any case, that led me to thinking I&#39;d make <a href=""https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/member/views/fennel-leek-and-celery-quiche-50178739"">a fennel quiche</a>. It&#39;s easy enough to make, and it reheats nicely. Despite appearances, my dedication does not extend with making a quiche from scratch every day for lunch.<br/>
<br/>
As much as I love the freedom to cook more and more elaborately, I&#39;m also ready for a bit of a break. One of my go-to speedy suppers is <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2013/aug/22/how-to-make-perfect-bean-burgers"">a black bean burger</a> with rosemary-thyme oven-roasted purple sweet potato wedges. I linked to an excellent recipe from Felicity Cloake. I like to make mine more interesting with some miso and Chinese five spice. It&#39;s obviously not necessary to use purple sweet potatoes. They&#39;re fun, though, if you can find them.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also hoping that I can get some nice fish to do <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlsEkjy_pFI"">a fish stew</a>. It&#39;s maybe not quite in season, but it snowed over this weekend, and I&#39;m in the mood for something warming and comforting. This will go with some nice polenta and in-season asparagus. Fingers crossed my local Whole Foods has the good stuff in stock. Assuming they have fresh asparagus, I&#39;ll probably chargrill the asparagus under the broiler, maybe finished with a vinaigrette.<br/>
<br/>
This plus leftovers from last week will likely tide me over for the week ahead. I am very tempted to buy some skirt steak and make steak with&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/03/chimichurri-argentina-cuisine-condiment"">chimichurri sauce</a>. That would go very nicely with oven-roasted new potatoes and more of that in-season asparagus. If you&#39;re looking for a vegetarian option, I love this <a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/ede13012-67b3-11e5-97d0-1456a776a4f5"">barbecue eggplant preparation</a> from the lovely people at Honey and Co in London.<br/>
<br/>
For something sweet and a little more experimental, I&#39;m going to continue feeding my rye-chocolate obsession. There&#39;s a recipe for rye double-chocolate cookies Joanne Chang&#39;s <a href=""https://flourbakery.com/pastrylove/"">latest cookbook,&nbsp;</a><em><a href=""https://flourbakery.com/pastrylove/"">Pastry Love</a>,</em>&nbsp;that I&#39;m planning to give a try.<br/>
<br/>
Until next week,<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week Six","Hello once again dear readers,<br/>
<br/>
When I threw together this idea a couple of weeks ago, more than one person told me that the name was too fatalistic. Then I discovered that the Financial Times has <a href=""https://www.ft.com/bunkerfood"">a new feature called &quot;Bunker Food.&quot;</a> If that&#39;s not fatalistic, I don&#39;t know what is. So I shall take solace&nbsp;knowing&nbsp;I share a fatalistic&nbsp;sense of humor with the editors of the FT. It&#39;s good company to keep.<br/>
<br/>
One of my classic recipes threw me for a loop. Due to the ongoing flour shortage, I decided to make the shortcrust pastry for my fennel tart with my somewhat less depleted stock of white whole wheat flour. That was a mistake. The dough had no elasticity and fell apart as I was trying to roll it out. As was buying one of the last pieces of Gruy&egrave;re cheese at my local Whole Foods. It was strangely bland. Needless to say, the fennel tart did not meet its usual standard.<br/>
<br/>
I also failed to read the recipe for the rye double-chocolate cookies well enough, so I&#39;ll have to give that recipe another shot in the week ahead. I did not buy enough chocolate, and didn&#39;t realize that I was completely out of walnuts.<br/>
<br/>
After a week with minimal experimentation, I&#39;ve decided to take another stab at making&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50-yxbahn5I"">croissants</a>. My most recent attempt last Christmas set the oven on fire and required the use of a fire extinguisher. I&#39;m hoping to do more than a little better than that. The secret, apparently, is using butter with a very high fat content.<br/>
<br/>
For the week ahead, I&#39;ve decided to go a little offbeat and do a <a href=""https://thehappyfoodie.co.uk/recipes/vegetable-and-lentil-cottage-pie"">vegetarian cottage pie</a> to last me through the week for lunch. I may have had to buy more red lentils than I was expecting to a couple of weeks ago when I made the red lentil and coconut soup.<br/>
<br/>
As it&#39;s going to be a rainy week and I haven&#39;t really eaten any pasta for a month, I thought I&#39;d go back to an old favorite and do my quick <a href=""https://ricette.giallozafferano.it/Ragu-alla-bolognese.html"">rag&ugrave; alla bolognese</a>&nbsp;with rigatoni. I feel like I&#39;m not truly participating in our collective confinement without eating some pasta. It also reheats nicely and might make a nice lunch one or two days during the week. At dinner, I like to precede that with a sharp arugula and parmesan salad, which is nothing more than baby arugula tossed with shaved parmesan cheese and a <a href=""https://www.bonappetit.com/story/how-to-make-vinaigrette"">quick vinaigrette</a>.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been seduced again by Taku Sekine&#39;s Instagram account, and have a yen to make <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/B_KeecwJtCt/"">scallion pancakes</a>.<br/>
<br/>
I feel slightly sacrilegious about it, but I&#39;m planning to pair that with <a href=""https://www.vickypham.com/blog/spicy-lemon-grass-chicken-ga-chin-sa-ot"">lemongrass chicken</a>, jasmine rice, and pan-seared tenderstem broccoli with honey, garlic, and red pepper flakes. I&#39;d also highly recommend Charles Phan&#39;s cookbook, <a href=""https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/209665/vietnamese-home-cooking-by-charles-phan/"">Vietnamese Home Cooking</a>. His restaurant, The Slanted Door, in San Francisco, is a favorite.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re looking for something else, this week I&#39;ll suggest doing a simple roast chicken. I&#39;m a big fan of the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6bToj3Tj94"">Thomas Keller recipe</a>, roasting the chicken on a bed of root vegetables. I&#39;d also highly recommend using the chicken remains to make a simple chicken stock. As I mentioned in one of the earlier missives, chicken stock made with an actual chicken is so much better than the stuff in a box or a can, it&#39;s almost hard to believe. And it&#39;s so easy: take the chicken remains (read: carcass), toss it in a giant pot with some chunks of carrot, celery, and maybe some thyme and peppercorns, cover it with water and let it gently simmer for a few hours. Then strain, and you can even freeze it for making soup or risotto a month from now.<br/>
<br/>
As ever, if you&#39;re enjoying this &mdash; or not &mdash; I&#39;d love to know, and I&#39;d once again encourage you to share this with your friends if you&#39;re enjoying it. It&#39;s a slightly steeper hill to climb to get this into triple figures, but given how long this confinement may last, I figure it&#39;s worth a try.<br/>
<br/>
Until next week,<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week Seven","Hello once again fellow confined readers,<br/>
<br/>
<span style=""caret-color: rgb(85, 85, 85); color: rgb(85, 85, 85); font-size: 16px; font-style: normal;"">The last week has been mostly successful. Once again, I still haven&#39;t quite found a place to try making the rye double-chocolate cookies. My closest attempt was the evening I almost made them, but decided I wanted something lighter and threw together a&nbsp;</span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2010/oct/14/how-to-make-perfect-crumble"" style=""font-style: normal; font-size: 16px;"">blueberry crumble</a><span style=""caret-color: rgb(85, 85, 85); color: rgb(85, 85, 85); font-size: 16px; font-style: normal;"">. I did rouse myself to trying scallion pancakes for the first time. They were very tasty &mdash; the simple soy-vinegar sauce makes all the difference &mdash; even if I couldn&#39;t quite get them as light and fluffy as I had hoped the would be.</span><br style=""caret-color: rgb(85, 85, 85); color: rgb(85, 85, 85);""/>
<br/>
I&#39;m now realizing that I repeat certain dishes more often than I thought. This is in some ways a good exercise to make me bring some old favorites back into my rotation. Though I have to also admit there are some things I have trouble motivating myself to prepare when it&#39;s only me. The other day the idea of a nice lasagne came into my head, and it seemed like too much bother.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of repeats, I&#39;ve decided that now is the time to try doing bao again. They&#39;re a little too light as a standalone dinner, as I discovered on my first attempt, but I think they could work well as the better part of a lunch. The plan is to make a batch, stash them in the refrigerator, and then revivify them in the steamer during the week. Once I got a handle on the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3FYCE5DHH4"">pleating technique</a>, it all fell into place.<br/>
<br/>
For something a little more classic, I&#39;m going to do a <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/B_edxtSpg3q/"">miso salmon</a> donburi, though I&#39;m out of furikake and I have my doubts about the vaguely Asian section of my local Whole Foods. I&#39;ve been so disappointed by the dried soba noodles they sell I&#39;m going to try <a href=""https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-soba-noodles-from-scratch-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-191038"">making my own soba noodles</a> from scratch to do a cold <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2015/06/soba-pasta-salad-seaweed-cucumber-asparagus-recipe.html"">soba noodle and vegetable salad</a>.<br/>
<br/>
My favorite baking YouTube channel has me in the mood to do a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwv7knrNK78"">fougasse</a>. And fougasse means I have to do something redolent of the south of France. Between the late spring and pandemic, I&#39;m not convinced I can get good enough produce to make a convincing salad ni&ccedil;oise, and it&#39;s definitely too early in the season to do my take on a ratatouille. So instead I&#39;m going to deplete my supply of frozen fish and try improvising something with cod, fennel, and haricots verts. I suspect a large quantity of olive oil and maybe some thyme will be involved.<br/>
<br/>
In the same spirit, for another idea, I also considered doing a <a href=""https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/11514-pan-bagnat"">pan bagnat</a>, another classic from the Nice region. It&#39;s actually pretty simple, and by far the best way to used tinned tuna as a sandwich. Though if you&#39;re going to make a pan bagnat, it&#39;s probably worth getting good tinned tuna rather than the dull generic stuff. For something vegetarian, I almost decided to do Felicity Cloake&#39;s <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/apr/29/felicity-cloake-perfect-vegetarian-chilli-recipe"">vegetarian chili recipe</a> this week.<br/>
<br/>
For something sweet, I&#39;m going to make my third attempt at mustering the energy to do the rye double-chocolate cookies. In the spirit of creating somewhat original content, last weekend was Anzac Day, and, solemnness aside, it&#39;s a good excuse to make some <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/apr/24/chewy-or-crisp-which-anzac-biscuit-recipe-should-you-bake"">Anzac biscuits</a>.<br/>
<br/>
As ever, I&#39;d love feedback, and if you&#39;re enjoying this, drop a line to your friends!<br/>

Until next week,<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week Eight","<div>Hello fellow cooks,<br/>
<br/>
The last week has been a mix of success and failure. Rather than make&nbsp;croissants, I gave some friends a lesson in making baguettes. They all did me proud. That bread wound up replacing the fougasse that I was planning to make. One can only eat so much.&nbsp;I&#39;m going to have to find another excuse to giving fougasse a try after my last somewhat disastrous attempt probably a decade ago.<br/>
<br/>
My first attempt at soba was more of an unmitigated disaster. I didn&#39;t have the right kind of buckwheat flour, and the noodles really did not work. They were borderline inedible, and certainly didn&#39;t make for an especially nice noodle salad. Apparently they&#39;re very finicky. I&#39;ve found <a href=""https://ansonmills.com/recipes/631"">another recipe</a> from a fancy artisanal mill that makes me think this is going to be even finickier than French bread. Depending on my mood, I may put in an order for some of their buckwheat flour and see if my second attempt is any more successful.<br/>
<br/>
My second pass at bao did make for a nice lunch. They still don&#39;t look quite as good as the ones in glossy food photos, but they&#39;ve passed the&nbsp;&nbsp;Adding dried porcini&nbsp;failed to turn my improvised vegetarian barbecue mushroom filling&nbsp;into something&nbsp;truly delicious. I don&#39;t want to give up on finding a good formulation for a veggie filling, but there may come a point I decide these are more of a treat and use pork.<br/>
<br/>
For the week ahead, I&#39;m going to do another roast chicken, assuming I can get my hands on a bird. That should take care of dinner one evening, maybe two, and, more importantly gives me another chance to use the leftovers for other interesting ideas. In particular, I&#39;m thinking of doing a <a href=""https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/curried-chicken-salad-106566"">curried chicken salad</a> tartine with more dark crusty bread. I like to swap yogurt for the mayonnaise for food preservation reasons more than anything. If you&#39;re going to use mayonnaise, you have to make it yourself, and you have to use raw egg yolks. It&#39;s not a combination that keeps especially well.<br/>
<br/>
The chicken salad likely won&#39;t last the week, so I&#39;m thinking of also using this as a chance to refine my technique for the <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/B_KeecwJtCt/"">scallion pancakes</a> I tried recently. I&#39;ll probably pair that with something that doesn&#39;t require a ton of cleanup like a fennel or arugula salad.<br/>
<br/>
Asparagus season appears to have come and gone without my local Whole Foods getting the good stuff. Perhaps I need to make a trip to Eataly. Something about that feels like a violation of the spirit of our current confinement. Even going for provisions once a week feels like it might be too often.&nbsp;I&#39;m still keeping my eyes peeled in any case. And if they have it, I&#39;m in the mood for something classic like <a href=""https://food52.com/recipes/21539-roasted-asparagus-with-poached-egg-and-lemon-mustard-sauce"">this preparation</a> with a mustard sauce and a poached egg.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the chicken, I&#39;m going to do a <a href=""https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/wild-mushroom-tartlets"">mushroom tartelette</a>. I&#39;m on the fence about using puff or shortcrust pastry. The shortcrust pastry feels better to me. I have a very strong association between mushrooms and puff pastry vol-au-vent served at fancy parties. Something about that makes me want spinach.&nbsp;I could do something in step with that (like spinach quickly wilted&nbsp;with garlic in a very hot pan), but I&#39;m probably going to go rogue and do something closer to a <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/nov/13/how-to-cook-saag-paneer-recipe-felicity-cloake"">saag paneer</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apropos of nothing, my favorite baking YouTube channel had <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyICmrMlH9Q"">a video on making crackers</a> with leftover levain. It&#39;s not really possible to have drinks parties for obvious reasons, and there&#39;s something about being on a video conference call that makes other people eating very strange, but I still think it&#39;s worth experimenting with.<br/>
<br/>
For something sweet, I&#39;m going to finally try the rye double-chocolate cookie recipe. Yes, really. I&#39;ll post a photo <a href=""http://instagram.com/josephkibe/"">on Instagram</a>. If you&#39;ve already tried the double-chocolate cookie recipe because I&#39;ve now mentioned it three weeks in a row, I still think it&#39;s too early to switch fully into summer dessert mode. I&#39;m going to suggest doubling down on chocolate and trying this <a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/8f72db66-785c-11ea-af44-daa3def9ae03"">recipe for milk chocolate and condensed milk cupcakes</a> from the folks at&nbsp;Honey and Co.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re enjoying this, I&#39;d once again encourage you to share this with your friends. I&#39;d also love to know if you&#39;re trying anything new, or have any ideas for what I should cook next.<br/>
<br/>
Stay sane,<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week Nine","Hello yet again dear readers,<br/>
<br/>
Finally, for real, I made a batch of the much-mentioned double-chocolate rye cookies from Joanne Chang&#39;s latest cookbook, <a href=""https://flourbakery.com/pastrylove/"">Pastry Love</a>. I&#39;m tempted to tinker with them the next time I make them. The rye didn&#39;t come through the many (and, let it be said, wonderful) layers of chocolate.<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3606378"" height=""480"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/396c8556-ea62-480d-8447-0b56b0e96abb.jpeg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>Nothing else was tremendously remarkable. It&#39;s been forever since I&#39;ve done a curried chicken salad, and it&#39;s still as good a concept as ever. Scallion pancakes are one of my new favorite things. Though perhaps that&#39;s not so surprising given they&#39;re bread with some scallions baked in. I also walked some folks through making scones. Mine were a little homely looking due to inattention, but otherwise quite nice.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3604138"" height=""480"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/5544fbec-88fe-4c3c-ba8a-3c4f0020f7a0.jpeg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>I&#39;ve decided to make pasta my big project for the week ahead. For a few months when I was a teenager I borrowed a pasta machine and made a lot of it, and I hadn&#39;t tried making fresh pasta again until fairly recently. That attempt convinced me I had lost my touch. But I also have a moratorium on buying any new kitchen equipment until I&#39;ve finished renovating my kitchen &mdash; who know when that will be &mdash; which means no pasta machine. I&#39;m going to take a risk &mdash; and risk wasting some precious flour &mdash; and try doing <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi5XGxw4oeY"">fresh pasta by hand</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I can&#39;t quite summon the energy to cook, and last weekend I bought some frozen butternut squash ravioli from the freezer case in lieu of making lunch. They weren&#39;t that bad, but they also weren&#39;t the best thing I&#39;ve ever eaten. The filling was a little too sweet, and the pasta was a little too thick and gummy. That seems like a good enough place to start to me. It&#39;s been at least a decade since I&#39;ve made stuffed pasta from scratch, so it should be an adventure. The thought is to make a <a href=""https://www.salepepe.it/ricette/primi/pasta-ripiena/tortellini-tortelloni-tortelli/tortelli-zucca/"">big batch of squash ravioli</a>, and have those for lunch.<br/>
<br/>
After making two giant batches of chicken stock in the last two months, I need to make something that will use at least some of it up. I could obviously make soup, though after having soup for lunch the better part of six weeks, I&#39;m inclined to do something a little different. I considered doing a chicken braise. The weather is feeling more springlike, and that feels too heavy. I&#39;m going to be a little bit boring and do a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_dDUw_QuDU"">paella</a>. It&#39;s really not that hard to make at home. I usually wind up using arborio rice, which is pretty easy to find. In more normal times I might hunt down Spanish bomba rice, and even then I&#39;m not entirely convinced it&#39;s that much better.<br/>
<br/>
My local fish counter has been more poorly stocked than usual. I&#39;d really like to try recreating a simpler variation on a monkfish dish I had at a very swanky restaurant on vacation last winter. There&#39;s no way I&#39;m making a foie gras sauce at home, but I would like to steal their idea of cutting the fish into sections, rather than cooking a piece whole. Keeping with its inspiration without going quite as far, I&#39;ll probably make a <a href=""https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/beurre-blanc-233266"">beurre blanc</a>.

"Confinement Cooking, Week 10","<div>Hello again hungry readers,<br/>
<br/>
When I began doing this, I think I had an inkling that it would last more than a couple of weeks. It&#39;s still surreal that this is the tenth week with no restaurants and a mandate not to make more than one trip for food a week.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, I was not able to get my hands on monkfish last week. So instead I bought some outrageously overpriced (though admittedly very tasty)&nbsp;halibut, which I also cooked in small pieces, and served with a beurre blanc. The hit of vinegar with the sweetness of the wine and richness from the butter and cream is fantastic.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3615334"" height=""426"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/fdcbd453-80c9-4159-96ff-2c750234a57f.jpeg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>The hand-rolled pasta was actually fairly successful from a how-good-does-this-taste perspective. The&nbsp;filling could&#39;ve been a touch sweeter &mdash; maybe a hint of honey next time; I couldn&#39;t get my hands on amaretto biscuits &mdash; but it was otherwise very nice. It was less successful from an effort-versus-flavor perspective. The pasta machine really is helpful for rolling it out. If this confinement lasts much longer, I may have to make an exception to my moratorium on new kitchen equipment.<br/>
<br/>
For the week ahead,&nbsp;I&nbsp;discovered that the local Eataly is open for business, less the restaurants. This is exciting because it means I can get really good canned tomatoes again. I&#39;m a fan of the <a href=""https://www.eataly.com/us_en/afeltra-peeled-san-marzano-tomatoes-14-oz"">Afeltra product</a>, which is also available to order online if you&#39;re not near an Eataly. Their&nbsp;dried pasta is also superb, if a little pricey.&nbsp;Something about the tomato availability&nbsp;(and perhaps their excellent value fresh mozzarella) put me in the mood to do pizza at home again.&nbsp;It would be nice if I could have it outside in the summer sun at my favorite pizza place, but that, alas, looks unlikely to be possible.<br/>
<br/>
I use&nbsp;<a href=""https://recipes.oregonlive.com/recipes/saturday-pizza-dough"">Ken Forkish&#39;s&nbsp;Neapolitan-style pizza dough</a>&nbsp;recipe. His pizza place in Portland is a favorite. I&#39;m also a huge advocate of the <a href=""https://www.bakingsteel.com"">baking steel</a>, made here in Massachusetts, apparently. It makes a big difference, and it&#39;s great for baking bread as well. At home I always go for the&nbsp;basic&nbsp;margherita&nbsp;with tomato sauce, cheese, and fresh basil. My one nod to heterodoxy is the addition of thyme, likely the product of the summer I spent in the Languedoc.<br/>
<br/>
Both Ken&#39;s and Marta, Danny Meyer&#39;s great pizza place in New York, do roasted vegetable platters along with the pizza, cooked (I assume)&nbsp;in the same fancy super hot ovens. My lack of a wood-burning brick oven notwithstanding,&nbsp;I feel a lot less guilty blasting the oven for dinner if I can also take care of the greens portion of the meal.<br/>
<br/>
Keeping with the posh takeout theme, something has put me in the mood for tacos as well. I don&#39;t know that I follow a recipe, exactly. Usually I do something like <a href=""https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/yogurt-marinated-grilled-chicken-366453"">yoghurt-marinated chicken</a> or <a href=""https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/fish-taco-recipe-1921022"">marinated fish</a>, throw together a few accouterments like <a href=""https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/quick-pickled-onions-395938"">quick pickle onions</a> and a <a href=""https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/salsa-recipe-1910950"">simple salsa</a>, add some cilantro and&nbsp;<em>crema</em>, and do a bit of DIY at the table with good store-bought corn tortillas.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I&#39;m going to put my newfound pasta-making skills to use and toss together a simple pasta with a salad of some sort. Cutting strips is a lot easier than making a filling and delicately joining two sheets of pasta.&nbsp;My desperation for asparagus may push me over the edge and get me to buy the slightly suspicious stalks imported from California, likely grown year round. It&#39;s never the same as the really good in-seasons stuff, but I have to have my fix. As a salad, I love serving it just-cooked sort of lukewarm with an <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/10/t-magazine/food/asparagus-recipe-london-river-cafe.html"">anchovy dressing</a>. For the pasta, maybe a green bean and tomato tagliatelle.<br/>
<br/>
While I would hardly call the response to the pandemic adequate, it&#39;s getting better, and businesses have begun tentatively reopening. Partly out of laziness, partly out of a desire for novelty, and partly out of a genuine desire to keep these folks in business, I&#39;m planning to go out and buy my lunches next week. It&#39;s a great excuse to get out of the house in the afternoon. It&#39;s great to be able to support places like <a href=""https://flourbakery.com"">Flour</a>.<br/>
<br/>
A few weeks ago I had planned to give making croissants another try. I can&#39;t remember what displaced that, but suffice to say I didn&#39;t do it. This week, I&#39;m doing another bake-along with friends. I fear their confidence in me is misplaced, but we&#39;ll give it a try. For anyone who&#39;s been disappointed that I link so often to my favorite YouTube channel in French, they&#39;ve <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWkqIdZZJdY"">subtitled the croissant videos</a> in English.<br/>
<br/>
That may not be enough in the sweet department, however. The weather here has also turned, which means we&#39;re back in fruit dessert territory. In all likelihood, I&#39;ll toss together some kind of fruit tart. What exactly, I&#39;ll probably decide when I see what my local Whole Foods has on offer. There&#39;s some artistry involved, but it will almost certainly have a <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/03/pate-sucree-tart-shell-recipe.html"">p&acirc;te sucr&eacute;e base</a>. One of my goals in life is to replicate the amazing white peach tart I had at a nondescript restaurant I happened upon one summer in the south of France. Perhaps in an August edition of the newsletter.<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week 11","<span style=""font-size: 16px;"">Hello again fellow food enthusiasts,</span><br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been another week of ups and downs in the food department.<br/>
<br/>
On the plus side, having the folks at Flour back in my life has been great. While tossing together lunch (by which I mean reheating something I&#39;ve made earlier) is hardly a burden, it&#39;s nice to have someone else cook for me, and also great to have an excuse to leave the house and go for a walk in the middle of the day.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3622902"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/aa99083f-f1fb-4ce0-8b38-8c432a31f0d9.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>My cook-along with friends last weekend was also a success. I still haven&#39;t quite mastered the croissant, but I made progress. I had a lot less butter leakage than the previous batches I&#39;ve made, and the lamination was excellent. It&#39;s also gratifying to see a bunch of lovely people &mdash; none of whom had ever made croissants before! &mdash; give it a great first attempt. I think we all came away with something that at least tasted great. The pizza was also pretty good. I&#39;m a little more practiced at that. I was also reminded how much better the good tinned tomatoes are than the ersatz San Marzano tomatoes at Whole Foods.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3622602"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/856e5c3d-73f3-4c43-80e6-23a33a7a7050.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>I tried Caviar for the first time, and was not bowled over. I used it to place a pickup order at one of my favorite fashionable bowl places (think Sweetgreen, except it wasn&#39;t Sweetgreen in the case), and they forgot to include my fish. The recourse? Apparently I was supposed to violate all the public health guidance and inspect the bowl before leaving.<br/>
<br/>
For the week ahead, I&#39;m going to resume my make-at-home lunches. Wonderful as Flour, Sweetgreen, and my other favorite lunch spots are, I need a little more variety in my life. I&#39;ve given up on making my own stuffed pasta without a pasta machine, so I&#39;ll pick up some prepared ravioli of some sort. Don&#39;t judge. I&#39;m also planning to throw together a batch of black bean soup. It&#39;s a favorite, and it&#39;s been at least a month since I&#39;ve done that for lunch.<br/>
<br/>
I half joke that I like to have a steak a couple of times a year, and I think this week may be one of my steak weeks. There&#39;s a part of me that wants to go all-out and do a ribeye steak with an incredibly rich mustard-cognac-butter sauce. Then I remember that it&#39;s effectively summer, and that&#39;s a bit too heavy. Instead, I&#39;m planing to do a <a href=""http://www.recipes.polyscienceculinary.com/recipe/sous-vide-skirt-steak/"">skirt steak cooked&nbsp;<em>sous vide</em>&nbsp;in a water bath</a>, then seared, and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/feb/21/spicy-skirt-steak-thai-meatballs-recipes-thomasina-miers"">served with a chimichurri</a>, crusty bread, and a light salad. Never in my life have I been buying this much flour or this much parsley.<br/>
<br/>
Because I&#39;m boring and bored, I&#39;m going to resurrect something I haven&#39;t made in at least a decade: the <a href=""https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ina-garten/indonesian-ginger-chicken-recipe-1913010"">Ina Garten ginger chicken</a>. My frugality and sense of civic duty are too strong to let me do it, but I do muse about renting a house in Amagansett to escape the monotony of my admittedly rather cushy urban confinement. For what I could afford, I doubt the kitchen facilities would be a lot better. I doubt too the farmer&#39;s markets are going to be quite as vibrant as usual this summer with safe distancing in place. Though being close to the beach and away from traffic would be nice. Her store on Long Island shut down years ago now from what I understand. Somehow my brain made the connection.<br/>
<br/>
As penance for my bovine sins, I&#39;m also going to do a vegetarian dinner. My default for veggie dinner is usually something with mushrooms, which I like, but I&#39;m always in search of variety. So instead, I&#39;m going to do a <a href=""https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/7517-masoor-dal-spiced-red-lentils"">dal with red lentils</a>, with other veggies, and &mdash; assuming I can get my hands on a resupply &mdash; basmati rice.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3630578"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/f585eeb1-a723-417d-b0d7-785b0c911167.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>For something sweet, I&#39;m very tempted to make another run at croissants. Or if not that, perhaps I&#39;ll pick up some extra apples, and try to recreate one of my real favorites: the <a href=""https://www.poilane.com"">Poil&acirc;ne tarte aux pommes</a>. I&#39;ve made the link between the folding technique for those and the bao, and I think I&#39;m ready for another attempt. Though I may not make my own puff pastry.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3622906"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/92defdda-13ca-4870-849d-5d149ffc01ad.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>Oh, and one more glamour shot of the croissants to keep you interested. Largely because styling fish tacos without them getting cold was not going to happen. (Flavor and my eating pleasure come first.) As ever, I&#39;d love to hear your confinement cooking stories, and if you&#39;re enjoying this, please tell your friends! It was pretty easy to break into the tens of subscribers, but 100 is a steeper climb.<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week 12","Hello once again dear readers,<br/>
<br/>
Another week, another raft of meals behind me and to come.<br/>
<br/>
Everything went more or less according to plan. The black bean soup was as good as ever. The red lentil dal was a wonderful spicy kick in this hot weather.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3644990"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/834b9d6b-7ff1-4e21-8fe5-a1573f615959.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/><br/>
Forcing myself to haul out my immersion circulator was a great excuse to play around with low-temperature cooking. Steak with chimicurri is pretty difficult to mess up, especially when it&#39;s cooked in a water bath. I did put together the fact that chimicurri is very similar to an Italian salsa verde. Not that there&#39;s anything wrong with that. More interesting was the Ina Garten recipe, which I wound up cooking&nbsp;<em>sous vide</em>&nbsp;rather than in a roasting pan in the oven. I managed to track down a copy of the&nbsp;<em>Barefoot Contessa</em>&nbsp;TV episode&nbsp;featuring the dish, and realized she uses a far coarser grater than I would typically pull out for the ginger. The bigger bits of ginger were really nice.&nbsp;I loved the intense bursts of gingery fire as opposed to the mellower kick of something more finely grated. That said, I remain dubious that there&#39;s anything Indonesian about the&nbsp;recipe.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3644986"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/1862056c-9fb5-412c-aab5-53daae2589d0.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>In the end I did not make my own puff pastry (or even buy it) to do the <i>tartes aux pommes</i>. Instead I gave myself a bit of a breakfast treat and did more whole wheat currant scones. I also ran out of my usual morning black tea. Fortunately the scones didn&#39;t clash too much with the green tea I&#39;ve switched to. It will take some time to restock: I buy the majority of my tea &mdash; and all my breakfast black tea &mdash; from the excellent folks at <a href=""https://www.postcardteas.com"">Postcard Teas</a> in London.<br/>
<br/>
For the week ahead, I&#39;m keeping the bean theme going. I&#39;m going to try Felicity Cloake&#39;s <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/apr/29/felicity-cloake-perfect-vegetarian-chilli-recipe"">vegetarian chili</a> recipe from a few weeks ago. It makes me slightly uncomfortable realizing quite how similar it is to black bean soup, though I imagine the complexity of the chilis and not using exclusively black beans will make a difference. I think that will make a nice lunch for at least a few days during the week.<br/>
<br/>
Summer is well and truly here, so I&#39;m leaning in on summery food for dinner, even if I&#39;m still trying to keep inside for public health reasons. Eating outdoors doesn&#39;t usually seem like such an exceptional treat, and yet here we are.<br/>
<br/>
Assuming the great pasta shortage of 2020 has resolved itself and I can get some good spaghetti or other long pasta, I&#39;m in the mood for some <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/02/spaghetti-pasta-alle-vongole-clams-recipe.html""><em>spaghetti alle vongole</em></a>. This also presupposes I can get littleneck clams. I may have to settle for mussels. Though that&#39;s not really much of a consolation prize if I&#39;m honest. If push comes to shove, I&#39;d go mussels over clams any day. For rhetorical purposes, though, <em>spaghetti alle cozze</em>&nbsp;doesn&#39;t have the same currency.&nbsp;That needs something vegetable to go with it. If I were willing to be more uncouth I&#39;d do corn on the cob. Instead I&#39;ll be very orthodox and do something like a <a href=""https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/bruschetta-with-roasted-red-bell-peppers-1222"">bruschetta with roasted peppers</a> and good olive oil. What is air conditioning for if not to let you bake your own bread in any weather?<br/>
<br/>
Summer also makes me think tacos for whatever reason. I did fish tacos a couple of weeks ago, and for some variety I&#39;m going to do carnitas. Here again I turn to <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/sep/12/carnitas-slow-cooked-pork-recipe-mexican-felicity-cloake"">Felicity Cloake for a primer</a>. I&#39;ll probably take her serving suggestion and serve with a red cabbage-carrot salad, though I may round it off with some <a href=""https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/grilled-corn-with-herb-butter-51179080"">roasted sweetcorn</a> as well.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I&#39;m going to return to an old-new favorite: the <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/B_edxtSpg3q/"">white wine and miso marinated salmon</a> from chef Taku Sekine. It&#39;s so easy, and so incredibly good. Part of me wants to give myself the night off and do something incredibly easy like steaming some haricots verts and tossing them with lemon, olive oil, and sea salt. The more ambitious part of me wants to do a <a href=""https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/smashed-cucumber-salad-with-hot-vinegar"">smashed cucumber salad</a>. I realize the fish has a Japanese cant and the cucumber salad is more Chinese. I feel like it works. Knowing myself, without anyone other than myself to cook for or impress, I&#39;ll probably take the easy path.<br/>
<br/>
For something sweet, the weather makes me think strawberries. Fingers crossed I can get good fresh strawberries. If not, I may draw on my stash of frozen berries. Either way, I&#39;m in the mood for an <a href=""https://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/fruit-recipes/eton-mess/"">Eton mess</a>. Any political commentary is incidental.<br/>
<br/>
As ever, I&#39;d love your feedback. If you&#39;re enjoying this, please recruit your friends!<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week 13","Hello again from confinement,<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s now been possible to return to restaurants for about two weeks here in Massachusetts. Of course, this lifting of confinement restrictions came with virtually no notice and only allows restaurants to open with outdoor seating, so many places aren&#39;t ready or simply can&#39;t reopen. There&#39;s also the fact I want this to be over for real, and thus don&#39;t want to become a disease vector. If the public health situation remains stable by the end of next week, perhaps I&#39;ll venture outside.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, it&#39;s still lots and lots of cooking at home.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3656962"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/1f7bb381-3014-4ae5-94fc-47e86c28a3fc.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>As predicted, it wasn&#39;t really practical to do the <em>spaghetti con vongole</em>. My local Whole Foods wanted $6 for an entire kilo of mussels and 75 cents for&nbsp;<em>each</em>&nbsp;littleneck clam. I have no objection to paying serious money for serious ingredients, but this was a bridge too far. Littleneck clams aren&#39;t amazing in the same way as black truffle or even really good olive oil. So instead, I used muscles and did the pasta <em>alle&nbsp;cozze</em>. Definitely a success.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3656966"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/69428ab5-72bf-480f-a78e-e2b3b06e3366.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>The carnitas made for some excellent tacos too. It&#39;s a surprisingly easy technique, even if it takes a fair bit of time to let the pork simmer away. I improvised a salsa rosa, and the carrot-cabbage salad was a very good idea indeed.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3656958"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/bc16039e-ffef-4752-ad9e-646add9c9c70.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>My Eton mess was a bit of a mess. Mostly because I managed to wind up with a defective pint of cream. It was solid in the jug: more of a proto-butter than cream. Not that there&#39;s really that much to complain about when it comes to crisp-soft meringue with macerate red fruits.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3656954"" height=""426"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/45fd2d3c-3537-4cf9-b73b-3491f398d1bd.jpeg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>For the week ahead, I have to use some salmon. Usually by this time of the year it&#39;s possible to get fresh-caught wild salmon from my seafood counter. It&#39;s yet to arrive, so I&#39;ve kept buying big packs frozen wild salmon from the freezer case. It&#39;s so much better than the weird farmed stuff. Now that supplies have improved, I&#39;m hoping I can get some green lentils and do a preparation I tried to do earlier in the condiment: <a href=""https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/salmon-with-lentils-and-mustard-herb-butter-em-saumon-aux-lentilles-em-241768"">poached salmon with warm lentils</a>. I didn&#39;t really &quot;get&quot; this concept until I had it last winter at one of my now-favorite brasseries in Paris. It&#39;s not really the right season, but thinking of that meal, I&#39;m reminded of the lovely charred leek with vinaigrette that I had as a first course. All of which really has to be eaten with some good bread.<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3656950"" height=""426"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/d77e2bbb-e92d-41ee-a9c3-f65b3d88bfb8.jpeg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>It&#39;s warm now, but not hot-hot, so I&#39;m not quite ready for vichyssoise or gazpacho. Though I&#39;m continuing my tour of food from warmer climes. I&#39;m going to start with <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2013/08/jerk-chicken.html"">jerk chicken</a>. Invariably I won&#39;t be able to get my hands on a scotch bonnet pepper for the marinade, but honestly that might be for the best: my tolerance for spicy food is pretty low. Sadly, I&#39;m going to have to do the chicken in the oven rather than on a grill outside. I&#39;ll serve that with basmati rice and honey-glazed roast carrots.<br/>
<br/>
Making a giant batch of basmati rice will also let me try out a novel recipe for <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jun/06/yotam-ottolenghi-favourite-rice-recipes-fried-rice-feta-kofte-meatballs"">Mediterranean fried rice</a> from the always lovely Yotam Ottolenghi. Fortunately, no pomegranate seeds required. As previously mentioned, I&#39;m a big fan of anchovy dressings.<br/>
<br/>
For lunch, I&#39;m continuing my hybrid takeout-cook-at-home approach. The takeout menu remains more or less the same &mdash; I will not be returning to the cheap and cheerful sushi place that gave me low-sodium shoyu &mdash; and the at-home menu will be a return of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/B_KeecwJtCt/"">the scallion pancakes</a>. I&#39;m also giving a bit of a lesson on whipping those together to some folks.<br/>
<br/>
Great strawberries are still nonexistent at my local Whole Foods, so I&#39;m continuing to rely on frozen. But the weather is right for it, and frozen strawberries can be great. After the slight Eton mess disaster, I&#39;m going to try this rather fetching <a href=""https://www.magazine-mint.fr/articles/tarte-aux-fraises-et-a-la-melisse/"">deconstructed strawberry and lemon balm tart</a>. It goes without saying I&#39;m not optimistic about getting my hands on any lemon balm or even fresh currants. That&#39;s not going to stop me from doing something in this vein.<br/>
<br/>
As ever, I&#39;d love to hear from you! Feedback is very much appreciated, and please share with your friends as we navigate the slow return to something at least approaching normalcy.<br/>
<br/>
Stay hungry,<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week 14","<div>Hello and happy summer dear readers,<br/>
<br/>
This comes to you a day later than normal. In doing a bit of DIY a few days ago, I managed to completely destroy the right side of my body, which has made even typing more difficult than I would have guessed. It turns out using a hammer drill to make a hole in concrete is pretty physically demanding.&nbsp;You&#39;ll also have to forgive a slightly more abridged version than usual: I&#39;m attempting to write this using almost exclusively my left hand.<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, the last week was its usual swings and roundabouts. The more Mediterranean-angled fried rice that I mentioned last time was definitely a success. The addition of lemon peel is, I think, what took it over the top.&nbsp;I may need to up the portion size to make it a complete meal, but that&#39;s hardly a real complaint. I also had some real success with the bread I baked to go with my brasserie-inspired salmon-lentil-leek combination. It was the first baguette I managed to produce with the right interior crumb.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3670382"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/45c302ea-b25a-43d3-9bc2-dfcaefb70358.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>Less pleasingly, my local Whole Foods was out of <a href=""http://www.lalentillevertedupuy.com"">Puy lentils</a>. While, I&#39;m usually very skeptical of protected origin products, and I&#39;m sure there are people somewhere making very good or even superior Puy-style lentils, the Eden Organic green lentils my store did have were not as good as the real thing. I&#39;m still working on getting my whole roasted leeks up to the standard of the place where I realized the potential of the leek as a star of the show.<br/>
<br/>
It is finally well and truly hot here. In a less confused world that might mean having cool summer food outside in the heat. Alas, I have to do it indoors and pretend. But it is time to haul out the real summer fare.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t done a lot of drinks ideas here, though&nbsp;now is as good a time as any to start. I&#39;m planning to ride out the heat wave with a <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/01/how-to-make-perfect-summer-cup-pimms"">summer cup</a>. There&#39;s a part of me that wants to go the extra mile on this and make my own spirit blend, but I so strongly associate this with Pimm&#39;s, I&#39;ll probably pick up a bottle of No 1 for these purposes.<br/>
<br/>
For food, I&#39;m putting a real focus on light, warm weather fare. I think it&#39;s time to do some <a href=""https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/11514-pan-bagnat"">pan bagnat</a>, the classic tuna sandwich from the PACA region of France. I&#39;m not usually big on tuna sandwiches. I can&#39;t quite figure out whether I love the pan bagnat because the whole concept is great, or because I bother to get really good tuna when I make it.<br/>
<br/>
Keeping with the same theme, I&#39;m also planning to do a <a href=""https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/gazpacho-recipe-1937573"">gazpacho</a>. It&#39;s a pretty forgiving soup that will work with most tomatoes, but I&#39;m hoping I can get my hands on some seriously good heirloom varieties for an extra hit of complexity. That&#39;s not quite enough to make a meal, so, at the risk of cultural confusion, I&#39;m planning to pair that with some <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2000/aug/06/foodanddrink.recipes"">bruschetta</a>.&nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I&#39;m hoping I can get my hands on some nice <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/11/branzino-al-cartoccio-from-downtown-italian.html"">striped bass and oven roast that</a> with some white wine and mushrooms. I&#39;m trying to keep things simple, so I&#39;ll likely serve that with some polenta and perhaps a <a href=""https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/shaved-fennel-salad"">shaved fennel salad</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Tying back to the summer cup, I thought for a sweet this week I&#39;d toss together some kind of fruit <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2011/dec/22/how-to-make-perfect-trifle"">trifle</a>. I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s the pandemic or the general decline of post-Amazon Whole Foods, but I&#39;ve yet to see the really amazing locally-sourced summer fruit for sale yet. I may yet have to content myself with the frozen stuff, in which case I&#39;ll probably do something raspberry-inclined.<br/>
<br/>
Going against my very southern European theme for the week, I&#39;m planning to make a big batch of <a href=""http://shesimmers.com/2011/11/pad-thai-recipe-part-five-making-pad.html"">pad Thai</a> and do that for lunch with supplements from my local favorite lunch spots. I still have the world&#39;s largest block of tamarind in my refrigerator ready to go.<br/>
<br/>
If the public health trend here remains as good as it&#39;s been for the last month, I may finally venture out to a restaurant, assuming the weather cools down a bit. Evidence suggests being indoors with the air conditioning running is about the worst place to be when there&#39;s an airborne virus floating around.<br/>
<br/>
As ever, if you&#39;re enjoying this, I&#39;d love to hear from you and hear what you&#39;ve been doing to keep yourself fed as we continue to fight this disease. And if you&#39;re enjoying this, please tell your friends! Having an audience is definitely motivating.<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week 15","Hello dear readers,<br/>
<br/>
Sadly, my right arm still isn&#39;t quite right, so this will once again be slightly more abbreviated and not quite up to the same level of production value as I had achieved in some of the more recent dispatches. If you really are only reading this for the photos, you can get the slightly less polished stream of food photos from my <a href=""http://instagram.com/josephkibe/"">Instagram account</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The past week I&#39;ve been in a bit of a culinary funk. Partly due to a lack of inspiration, partly, I suspect, due to a certain amount of mediocre execution. I love pan bagnat, but my brilliant idea to combine pan bagnat with continued baguette refinement and execution did not do me any favors. That sandwich really needs a soft, squishy bread with a bit of width that can really take the pile of delicious fixings that go inside. For the pad Thai, I somehow managed to forget to buy several key ingredients, which made for something not bad, but also not great.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3681582"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/8c068092-1a26-494a-abc5-6afbb7492c20.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>Strawberries were the one bright spot. I finally managed to get my hands on some really excellent local berries, and they were amazing. For me by myself, I eventually decided that doing an entire trifle was a bit too much, and wound up doing shortcakes instead. I hadn&#39;t made shortcakes in years, and realized that they&#39;re scones by another name. I tried macerating the berries in some gin along with the sugar and a pinch of salt. I&#39;m not sure I could really detect the juniper, but it also definitely didn&#39;t detract from the wonderful berries.<br/>
<br/>
For the week ahead, I&#39;m trying to regain some of my confidence with a bit more experimentation.<br/>
<br/>
As it&#39;s the Fourth of July in a few days, I thought I could make burgers, albeit indoors in a pan. I don&#39;t have any special affinity for burnets, but it does give me a chance to try <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOkZCTuGvs0"">making my own burger buns</a>, which should be interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Keeping with the summery theme, I&#39;m going back to PACA and doing a sort of <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/2014/11/how-to-make-steamed-mussels-with-fennel-saffron-broth-easy-seafood-dinner-quick.html"">riff on bouillabaisse</a>, the traditional dish from Marseilles. It comes from Eric Ripert, who runs the truly amazing Bernardin seafood restaurant in New York, via Kenji L&oacute;pez-Alt over at Serious Eats. I thought about making a more classic bouillabaisse, but it&#39;s another one of those dishes I have difficulty finding the motivation to toss together without a group of other people to impress.<br/>
<br/>
I recently discovered the excellent Alex YouTube channel, which manages to combine my interests in food, engineering, and Gallic culture in one convenient place. His <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJjr9lmUhZE"">most recent series</a> has been about modifying his domestic oven to achieve the temperatures needed to make really good Neopolitan-style pizza. I&#39;m not about to slice open my oven, but it&#39;s got me in the mood to do pizza again. It&#39;s also a great excuse to pick up some prosecco. For newer readers, my <a href=""https://recipes.oregonlive.com/recipes/saturday-pizza-dough"">reference pizza dough recipe</a> is from Ken Forkish. His pizza place is a favorite.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I&#39;m going to take my attention back to working on doing great gnocchi. I found <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOig8WT_SgQ"">another tutorial</a> from an accomplished Tuscan chef with a more minimal approach that feels more in line with my general approach to food. No fussy ridged rolling board required. He rolls the dough into a snake with minimal additions, and simply cuts with a knife. I&#39;m going to pair this batch of gnocchi with a white wine and mushroom sauce.<br/>
<br/>
For something sweet, I felt the need to try something not made with strawberries, but still with a summery feel. While it&#39;s not exactly light &mdash; there&#39;s lots of cream involved &mdash; I love a <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2013/sep/19/how-to-make-perfect-lemon-posset"">lemon posset</a>. That could easily be combined with some macerated raspberries, blueberries, or really any other summer fruit. I have my fingers crossed I can get something other than strawberries that weren&#39;t grown for shipping en masse in Watsonville.<br/>
<br/>
Stay hungry and have a great long weekend,<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week 16","<div>Hello readers,<br/>
<br/>
Slowly, slowly, I&#39;m venturing outside. I&#39;ve now done a couple of lunches out and survived to tell the tale. On the other hand, dining out in the pandemic era lacks some of the conviviality of whatever we were doing before. I&#39;m still not willing to dine out more than once a week, and there&#39;s no way I&#39;m going to eat indoors or with more than one or two other people.&nbsp;I&#39;m still doing a lot more cooking at home than usual.<br/>
<br/>
Along those lines, for anyone French inclined, I ordered a copy of <a href=""https://alamaisonlelivre.com""><em>&Agrave; la maison</em></a>, a fun little cookbook project that puts together a few dozen confinement&nbsp;recipes from many big names in food to raise money for a food security charity. I&#39;ve begun to exhaust DIY projects, and it has crossed my mind to turn my hand to putting together some kind of cookbook.<br/>
<br/>
From the week that&#39;s been, it will come as no surprise that there were some victories and some real losses. It turns out that a chef who runs a fancy restaurant in Tuscany may have some intuitive judgement that I don&#39;t. Which is to say that my attempt at making minimalist gnocchi was a pretty serious failure. My hunch is that I needed to dry out the riced potatoes. Likewise my riff on a French fish stew was a little too heavy on tomatoes.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3693714"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/7a2e4b64-41fe-4128-8d9c-96db0efc6870.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>My burger buns were&nbsp;excellent, however. There will inevitably be a time that I&#39;ll need to buy some pre-made burger buns again in the future, but this is my new normal. The <a href=""https://www.kingarthurflour.com/blog/2018/03/26/introduction-to-tangzhong"">tangzhong method</a> is incredibly easy, and other than that small complication, making buns is a lot easier than something like a baguette.<br/>
<br/>
With the pizza, since I have to get the oven really hot anyway, I decided to do a <a href=""https://lefooding.com/fr/recettes-video-toquera/toquera-295-an-affair-with-un-chou-fleur-miznon"">Caf&eacute; Miznon-style cauliflower</a>. It&#39;s an incredibly simple preparation, but possibly the best way to do cauliflower.<br/>
<br/>
Moving ahead, I&#39;m taking another stab at Indian cuisine with a <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/feb/25/20-best-chicken-recipes-part-3-ofm-nigel-slater-tom-kerridge"">chicken biryani</a>. I don&#39;t know enough about Indian food to figure out if this is really seasonal. It&#39;s a fairly light, aromatic dish. But it&#39;s also cooked almost like a stew, which doesn&#39;t feel especially summery to me. On the other hand, the weather in, say,&nbsp;Delhi in January is about the same as it is here in the summer. Irrespective, it&#39;s good eating.<br/>
<br/>
Taking inspiration from one of my recent adventures in dining out, I&#39;m also thinking of doing more tacos. If for no other reason than that I&#39;m bored, I&#39;m thinking of doing tacos in the style of a <a href=""https://food52.com/recipes/20070-beer-battered-fish-tacos-with-cilantro-crema"">fish taco</a>, but substituting tofu for the fish. I had some tofu tacos (let it be said, alongside some chorizo tacos) on one of my recent lunches out, and they were really quite good.<br/>
<br/>
Continuing my slightly confused stumbling through disparate parts of the food world, I&#39;m thinking of taking a stab at <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2015/05/singapore-curry-noodles-stir-fry-recipe.html"">curried Singapore noodles</a>. In all honesty, I started exploring the various characteristic dishes of Singapore after reading Kevin Kwan&#39;s&nbsp;<em>Crazy Rich Asians</em>&nbsp;novels, and this wound up being a favorite. I&#39;m sure neither my home version nor&nbsp;anything I&#39;ve ever had at a restaurant in the United States holds a candle to the street food of Malaysia, but it&#39;s good enough for me for a weeknight dinner.<br/>
<br/>
For lunches in, I&#39;m very tempted to do more <a href=""https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/black-bean-burgers-351297"">black bean burgers</a>, if only as an excuse to make more tangzhong burger buns.<br/>
<br/>
Assuming I can get more excellent summer fruit, I&#39;m thinking of tossing together a <a href=""https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/fruit-galette"">galette</a> for something sweet. They have a lot of the drama of a fancy tart or other impressive dessert, but with a lot less work.<br/>
<br/>
As ever, I&#39;d love to hear from you! And for the millionth time, I&#39;ll make another plug for myself and suggest you share this with your friends if you&#39;re enjoying it.<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week 17","Hello readers,<br/>
<br/>
Over four months into this project, I have to admit I feel my enthusiasm fading a little bit. There&#39;s a part of me that wants to end the series and go back to cooking a little less publicly. But on the other hand, even the fairly limited audience I&#39;m speaking to here has been useful for motivating me to try new things and tinker around. At the point I still have to eat, and I do&#39;t really have a lot else to do, I&#39;ve realized I might as well keep it going.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I have taken some of my other time and taken to reviving a project to put together a cookbook. We&#39;ll see how far I get. If you&#39;ve ever felt cheated by the fact I link to recipes rather than sharing what I actually do, then perhaps this will be for you.<br/>
<br/>
But back to our normal business. The past week has been a little rough food-wise mostly because my neighborhood Whole Foods had mysterious shortages of just the ingredients I needed. They were completely out of thin rice noodles and the good frozen shrimp for the Singapore-style curried noodles. Even more surprising, they had no tofu for my not-fish fish tacos.<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3706046"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/6c7e844b-4ed9-45be-8d6a-9a7f07d5fc69.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>Fortunately I had some leftover tofu, so I was able to try the concept once. The beer batter was great, though I clearly need to get a probe for my thermometer that makes it easier to monitor the temperature of the fry oil. Periodically having to dip a probe in was rather perilous. I&#39;d still prefer fish tacos with actual fish, but the fried tofu really was a pretty acceptable substitute in my continuing effort to lower the carbon footprint of my diet.<br/>
<br/>
Much more successful was the biryani. The quality of the recipes that I found was more uneven than I appreciated when I tried to use them. So I had to improvise quite a bit. But now I think I understand the conceptual components of the dish, which should make it easier for me to get a real grip on. I wound up using a normal ratio of rice to water, which made the biryani less fluffy than I would have liked.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3706066"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/ac56cee6-9976-493c-882e-e0002e734187.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>I wound up making the galette with white peaches, which was very nice. It would have been a bit better with a little something to add complexity. If I do this again, I may try adding some thyme or maybe a bit of lemon.<br/>
<br/>
The week to come is going to be what one might call a refinement week. In particular, I really want to try another method (or two) for making gnocchi. They really don&#39;t seem like they should be that hard to make, and I&#39;m confident that there&#39;s a trick I&#39;m missing that many of the articles or videos online fail to mention. I&#39;m going to try out the <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/2015/03/how-to-make-light-tender-potato-gnocchi.html"">method from this post</a> over on Serious Eats. Depending on my mood, I&#39;ll either do that with a pesto sauce or repeat the herby mushrooms that I used on my last (disastrous) attempt at gnocchi.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to try refining the <a href=""https://www.spainonafork.com/steamed-mussels-with-garlic-saffron-sauce/"">saffron-tinted mussels</a> from a few weeks ago. The last time was a little bit too heavy on tomato. They&#39;re summery and fresh. To be served, of course, with great crusty bread. I mention this again because my favorite YouTube baker has subtitled a more <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60K3Fe5j_J8"">home cook-focused method</a> of making baguettes at home into English.<br/>
<br/>
There are also more low-carbon tacos on the docket with <a href=""https://www.nigella.com/recipes/sweet-potato-tacos-with-avocado-and-coriander-sauce-and-a-tomato-and-pear-relish"">sweet potato tacos</a>. While I don&#39;t follow her method exactly, I certainly take inspiration for this from Nigella Lawson&#39;s&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/1112857/at-my-table/9781784741631.html""><em>At My Table</em></a>. The sweet potatoes make a nice no-meat way to do tacos. I&#39;m not as in thrall to avocados as some people. I&#39;ll probably pair the sweet potato with a peppy salsa, quick pickle red onions, and copious amounts of fresh coriander. She has <a href=""https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/1119381/cook--eat--repeat/9781784743666.html"">a new book</a>, <em>Cook, Eat, Repeat</em>, coming later in the year that I&#39;m eager to read.<br/>
<br/>
For something sweet, I&#39;m returning to the <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/02/mixed-berry-pavlova-meringues-dessert-recipe.html"">pavlova neighborhood</a>. I have it in my mind to do something with raspberries, though in recent experience there won&#39;t be any truly great raspberries when I do my provisions run. The exceptional strawberries were very short-lived.<br/>
<br/>
And so we conclude again for the week. As ever, I&#39;d love your feedback, and if you&#39;re enjoying this, please tell your friends! I&#39;ve realized that I am only human, and a sense of momentum does help with my motivation for keeping this going.<br/>
<br/>
Until next week,<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week 18","Hello again readers,<br/>
<br/>
Call this week another triumph for the scientific method. Actually getting a handle on the mechanics of why different choices make sense for making gnocchi &mdash; thanks to the post I linked to last time &mdash; I finally managed to make some halfway decent dumplings at home. I still have some work to do, mostly in terms of dithering less so the gnocchi are a little lighter. But I was very pleased.<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3713966"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/13592c96-0b4d-4568-a02c-472c37f43cef.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>The key is&nbsp;moisture control. While&nbsp;I don&#39;t usually like russet potatoes, they have a lower water content that really works here. I also realized that I was not using anywhere near enough flour, and had taken the Italian cooks&#39; advice a little too much to heart. Those two changes, plus baking rather than boiling the potatoes &mdash; again to drive out moisture &mdash; appear to have done the trick. They were pillowy (and look a bit like pillows), soft, and, in a big improvement versus the last attempt, they did not disintegrate when boiled.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3713970"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/9864d9a2-6ed8-4cb0-90da-15378d8c9cf8.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>I was pretty pleased with my mussels as well. Switching from an entire can of tomatoes to a small dash of tomato paste gave me the intensity and savoriness of tomato rather than masking all the other flavors like the saffron.<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3713982"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/89b67b48-68af-4f1b-af9f-9261b15ba6ac.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>The tacos were good too. I remain convinced they&#39;re not very photogenic. Believe me when I say that I tried. Maybe my standards have gotten too high. Somehow they were also slightly disappointing from a gustatory perspective. I think it&#39;s possible I left the sweet potatoes in the oven too long in the name of developing crispness. They were very crispy in the end, but didn&#39;t have much of that fluffy goodness on the inside.<br/>
<br/>
Looking ahead, I&#39;m continuing to support my local takeout places for lunch for the most part. A recent favorite was the roasted tomato and fennel soup from my friends at Flour. Less thrilling has been the perpetual temptation-denial pattern of Sweetgreen putatively bringing back their roasted tomato bowl, only to tell me every time I go to order it that they&#39;re out of roasted tomatoes.<br/>
<br/>
Keeping with the weather, which is particularly scorching as I write this, I&#39;m maintaining my focus on light summery fare.<br/>
<br/>
One of my recently discovered favorites is <a href=""https://www.vickypham.com/blog/steamed-fish-with-scallions-ginger-and-soy-sauce"">steamed fish Vietnamese-style</a>. First, the fish is seasoned and gently steamed. Then you generously heap aromatic herbs over the fish &mdash; I like ginger and cilantro &mdash; and douse the whole thing in hot oil to bring out the flavor of the garnishes. It seemed kind of crazy to me when I first read about it, but it&#39;s not really as dangerous as it sounds (though I do it in the kitchen rather than at the table), and it really does bring out the flavor of the herbs. I&#39;d love to use striped bass for this, though I&#39;ll probably have to settle for something in the freezer case. This would go well with any manner of things, but I&#39;m probably going to pair it with steamed rice and braised greens with a hit of garlic and shallot to go with the fish.<br/>
<br/>
For something slightly more substantial, I&#39;m going to try out a <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2020/05/chicken-and-dried-fig-tagine-with-pistachios-and-chickpeas.html"">chicken and chickpea tagine</a>. It is very stew-like, but it&#39;s also fairly light, and something about the fact it comes from the Maghreb makes me feel like it does go with this weather after all. This of course has to be served with couscous. It&#39;s probably entirely nonsensical if I were trying to make the pairing food culturally coherent, but I really want to serve this with some artichokes in a nice vinaigrette.<br/>
<br/>
To round things out I&#39;m going to try this simple <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/apr/17/do-it-like-dishoom-favourite-dishes-from-uk-restaurants-to-cook-at-home"">recipe for beans with herbs and mozzarella</a> from the folks over at Ducksoup in London. If we&#39;re honest this might just be a great excuse to eat more bread, but I don&#39;t really see the problem with that. I&#39;ll probably toss together a simple green salad to go alongside as well.<br/>
<br/>
If I had a bigger kitchen, I&#39;d own an ice cream machine and impress you all with my grand plans to make some scratch vanilla ice cream with a <a href=""https://www.brit.co/salt-straw-ice-cream-recipe/"">Salt and Straw-style twist</a>. Alas, I don&#39;t, so I&#39;m going to have to sate that need with some store-bought vanilla ice cream, very possibly paired with some grilled stone fruit, if anything looks good when I go shopping. I&#39;ll probably also pick up some ladyfingers or other light crispy biscuits. They&#39;re an easy way to improve on plain ice cream by adding a bit of texture for contrast.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s not much end in sight for the extraordinary public health measures, so look forward to another edition next weekend. As ever, I&#39;d love to hear from you with feedback or ideas, and please share this with your friends if you&#39;re enjoying it.<br/>
<br/>
Stay hungry,<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week 19","Hello again,<br/>
<br/>
As I get deeper into the art of taking photos of what I&#39;m cooking, I&#39;m beginning to feel like the wardrobe director <span style=""caret-color: rgb(85, 85, 85); color: rgb(85, 85, 85); font-size: 16px; font-style: normal;"">with big dreams&nbsp;</span>on a low-budget TV show. My general approach to buying kitchen equipment and tableware is to buy quality over quantity. This has the byproduct that most of what I own looks pretty good in photos, except that I feel like I&#39;m repeating myself. Most of my tableware is white porcelain that goes with anything. Most of my cookware is All-Clad that looks exactly the same whether it&#39;s a tiny frying pan or a giant stock pot. I&#39;m getting uncomfortably close to the point of really going off the deep end and buying off cuts of different exotic kitchen countertop materials as props. Though I think it would be too off-brand to buy a piece of Star Wars-themed Le Creuset.<br/>
<br/>
Food-wise, the big highlight was my experiment with yet another riff on the North African tagine. As I was cooking, the idea of tossing many, many handfuls of dried figs into a chicken braise seemed crazy. The result was surprisingly excellent. The figs help thicken the sauce and add a nice sweet-savory tang.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3722970"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/f04f77ae-1fa6-4e43-8163-f45e46910873.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>My summer fruit expectations on my weekly shopping trip were once again not met. Rather than buy mediocre peaches, I bought some above-average (though not off-the-charts amazing) strawberries to deplete my remaining stash of par-baked shortcake. It was good, even if I felt somewhat unoriginal.<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3722966"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/4ab2a826-b210-402d-b2b4-893f1ac2d7fb.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>For the vegetarian main, I used the last of my stock of excellent Rancho Gordo beans. Tossing beans, cheese, and herbs together is simple enough that the quality of the beans really comes through. It also gave me a chance to enjoy one of the good olive oils I have kicking around.<br/>
<br/>
Looking ahead, I have the perhaps chimerical hope that I can get my hands on some really good cherry tomatoes and do a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zS5Wj7ZfIY"">spaghetti pomodorini</a>. Something about the idea of eating nothing but pasta for dinner does not work for me, so I&#39;ll pair that with something like a second course of grilled eggplant. Possibly involving <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/02/grilling-chinese-eggplant-with-sweet-ginger-miso-paste-recipe.html"">a miso glaze</a>, cultural dissonance aside. The spaghetti with small tomatoes also makes a nice light lunch on its own.<br/>
<br/>
Given it&#39;s going to be unbelievably hot again in the next few days, I&#39;m also going to return to the no-cook <a href=""https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/11514-pan-bagnat"">pan bagnat</a> from a few weeks ago. Last time I tried to do it on a baguette, and it didn&#39;t quite take. The bread is too crusty and narrow for the mass of ingredients that are piled on. My thought is to continue using the same dough, but shape it into some kind of square individual portion and bake it a little shy of what I&#39;d typically do.<br/>
<br/>
As ever, I have a giant pile of frozen salmon in my freezer that I feel like I need to use. It&#39;s also possible that my local Whole Foods will finally have fresh wild salmon in stock. I don&#39;t really have any grand aspirations for the fish. I&#39;ll simply <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/2019/08/how-to-grill-salmon-fillets.html"">grill it</a>, and serve it by itself. My experiment for the week will be with&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jul/25/yotam-ottolenghi-recipes-for-summery-green-side-dishes""><em>toum</em></a>&nbsp;via Yotam Ottolenghi&#39;s regular column in the Guardian. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll do a broad bean salad as he suggests; that will depend on what I find when I go shopping.<br/>
<br/>
Moving into the sweet portion of the plan, I feel like once again this will hugely depend on my level of enthusiasms for the summer fruit on offer. It may be time for me to resurrect the project to recreate the best <a href=""https://www.papillesetpupilles.fr/2018/07/tarte-aux-peches-citron-vert-et-romarin-yotam-ottolenghi.html/"">peach tart</a> I&#39;ve ever eaten. (To be extremely clear, the linked recipe is not the tart in question, which was in fact at an extremely nondescript caf&eacute; on the side of a very uninteresting road on the outskirts of Nice, France. Though the Ottolenghi recipe is very good.) It may be that I&#39;m so unenthusiastic I&#39;ll make some <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/2015/12/perfecting-coconut-macaroons-recipe.html"">coconut macaroons</a>, which have the topical air and hot weather-appropriateness from the coconut, but do not force me to use uninspiring summer fruit for the sake of it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be back again next week with another installment. Sadly, if anything the public health situation is getting worse, not better, even here in reasonably sane Massachusetts. I&#39;d love your feedback if you&#39;re enjoying this, and I&#39;d also heartily encourage you to share this with your friends if you&#39;re enjoying it.<br/>
<br/>
Until next week,<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week 20","Hello again,<br/>
<br/>
The confinement and thus the confinement cooking continues. If anything, it looks like my pessimism was well-judged, even here in reasonable Massachusetts. The idea of renting a house on a beach somewhere hasn&#39;t been entirely ruled out. Though the more I think about it, the more I realize the cost is less of a problem than having to live somewhere with limited restaurant options and a completely unknown kitchen. So at least for now there will be no photos from a photogenic kitchen in Edgartown.<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3739990"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/1b1fa334-85c9-4145-ba03-88f1a2b55d98.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>Whereas I can now call myself a fan of this levantine dressing called <em>toum</em>&nbsp;that I found in the Ottolenghi column a few weeks ago. It&#39;s really nothing more than extremely potent garlic oil. If you like garlic, however, as I avowedly do, it&#39;s fantastic. I wound up doing lima beans (I take what I can get) with shaved fennel, tarragon, and mint. It was very nice. Also handy that it requires very minimal cooking at the height of summer.<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3739994"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/0faa316d-5916-4593-9e8b-1c880f66921c.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>The miso eggplant was a bit underwhelming. My execution seemed not so much bland as kind of dilute; as if the glaze needed to be concentrated more, or the eggplant needed more time to become one with the glaze. That or jamming the eggplant under the grill obliterated something. On my second attempt I let the glaze sit on the eggplant for at least half an hour before tucking in to no avail. There was a run on good spaghetti, so I wound up going more whimsical and using gemelli for the pasta component to go with the eggplant.<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3739998"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/cf964219-dbdc-4077-90e8-90ec1f807695.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>I picked up some locally produced blueberries to do a quick crumble. My feeling was very neutral. They were fine. Aside from the one batch of strawberries a few weeks ago, nothing has really hit me over the head with amazingness this summer. Perhaps this is further evidence of Whole Foods&#39;s decline under the reign of King Bezos.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3740170"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/af088b95-13c1-4b0a-a14b-e6e724a230be.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/><img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3740174"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/695ded42-219b-403c-bdd6-239f29554b16.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>My devotion to the fine people at <a href=""http://flourbakery.com"">Flour Bakery and Caf&eacute;</a> for lunch has reached a new level. In the couple of months since they reopened I&#39;ve been often enough that I now qualify for a free tote bag. Of course what I really want is to throw them more money if they would only bring back the smoked salmon sandwich.<br/>
<br/>
Looking ahead, I&#39;m eagerly awaiting the arrival of my copy of <a href=""https://alamaisonlelivre.com""><i>&Agrave; la maison</i></a>, if only to have a new source of inspiration to cook from. On the other hand, it&#39;s shipping from either France or the Netherlands, which, given the state of the world, may mean it won&#39;t be here until September. I recently put in an order to restock tea from my favorite tea shop, <a href=""http://postcardteas.com"">Postcard Teas</a>. The parcel has been tied up in some kind of customs limbo for a few days now. They&#39;re really lovely people, and have miraculously survived the pandemic intact. Their products are excellent and not all that much more expensive than buying &quot;nice&quot; teabags at a grocery store. If you&#39;re into tea, I&#39;d highly recommend giving them some support.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, the latest Ottolenghi column in the Guardian features a stew that looked interesting. Summer doesn&#39;t usually seem like stew season to me, but who am I to disagree with the esteemed Yotam? The zing of lemon and the softness of dumplings sounds excellent to me, so I&#39;m going to give his <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/aug/01/yotam-ottolenghi-summer-comfort-food-cauliflower-cheese-filo-pie-lemon-chicken-dumplings-recipes"">lemon chicken with dumplings</a> a try.<br/>
<br/>
Whether it&#39;s summery I&#39;m not sure, but something has put me in the mood for <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecoyC4U2QvE"">risotto</a>. My staple shellfish and squid has been in short supply when I&#39;ve looked on my weekly shopping run, but I&#39;m crossing my fingers that they&#39;ll have what I need. I&#39;m in half a mind to pair that with more vegetables tossed with my copious leftover levantine garlic sauce.<br/>
<br/>
Keeping with the if not summery then plucked-from-a-culture-in-a-hot-climate theme, I&#39;m going to give myself a break and do <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/2013/06/the-food-lab-how-to-make-best-fajitas.html"">fajitas</a>. They offer great return on effort. When I do a stir fry, it winds up taking forever. I have to make rice, cut up lots of different vegetables, maybe some garlic, make a sauce, and I&#39;m always disappointed because my circa 1980 cooktop doesn&#39;t have enough power to get the pan as hot as it needs to be. Whereas fajitas really do only require cutting up a few vegetables, prepping some kind of protein, and I&#39;m really not that bothered if the vegetables get a little too soft. That said, I&#39;ll probably do something veggie, perhaps with marinated portobello mushrooms instead of steak.<br/>
<br/>
For a sweet, I&#39;m still not ready to make my annual attempt at recreating the mythical peach tart from the nondescript roadside caf&eacute;. For that reason, I&#39;ll probably commit to doing <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2015/12/the-best-coconut-macaroons-recipe.html"">coconut macaroons</a> this time. Unless I go into the store and my expectations are exceeded with some amazing local raspberries. I&#39;d love an excuse to do a raspberry <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGm6bIfKXWc"">panna cotta</a> with a hit of grappa.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all for this week. I&#39;ll be back again next week. It will be fun (if depressing in its way) to get into some fall recipes in a few weeks when the weather begins to turn. As ever, I&#39;d love your feedback, and please feel free to share with your friends!<br/>
<br/>
Until next time,<br/>
Joseph","2020-08-01 22:32:58"
"Confinement Cooking, Week 21","Hello again excellent readers,<br/>
<br/>
In my confinement cycle, I feel like I&#39;m in another food plateau week. It feels weirdly routine, even as the strange slow-fast pandemic time ticks forward. It&#39;s not good, though neither is it bad. It&#39;s very neutral, and I don&#39;t know how to feel about that.<br/>
<br/>
The coconut macaroons were all swings and roundabouts. On balance, they were good. I didn&#39;t get all the details right, and I have some perhaps more fundamental issues with the recipe. The coconut was too toasted. It&#39;s unclear to me what I did wrong there. My oven is pretty well-calibrated and I don&#39;t think the shredded coconut was especially exotic. Yet I felt like the coconut was way too rather than a little too toasted. Though my bigger issue was with the evaporated milk. Something about it gave the macaroons a wet sock bad funk&nbsp;rather than, say, an alluring aged cheese funk. The amount of sugar has slightly put me off the concept as well. It may be a few months before I return to this and work out the kinks.<br/>
<br/>
My risotto was once again disrupted by what I assume are supply chain issues due to the pandemic.&nbsp;Much to my dismay they didn&#39;t have the shellfish I wanted for the risotto at my friendly neighborhood Whole Foods. Instead, I bought what turned out to be a literal slab of frozen squid. It was impossible to separate before thawing, which necessitated some improvisation, lest the tubes and tentacles go to waste.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3752546"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/8bb649fb-953c-4f82-9de8-d8506cd8aea7.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>In the end, I tossed together some squid fajitas. While it was reasonably good, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d wholeheartedly recommend the concept. It wasn&#39;t helped by my lack of forethought. The squid really needed to sit uncovered in the refrigerator for a day to wick away surface moisture. Too much of the squid steamed rather than seared.<br/>
<br/>
Doing dumplings in the height of summer was a bridge too far, whatever Yotam says. Instead, I took the opportunity to make another run at the baguette with the lemon chicken less dumplings. Cranking the oven to 450 &deg;F isn&#39;t especially summery either, but at least culturally the baguette is a year-round food.<br/>
<br/>
Moving into next week, continuing with the bread theme I have it in my head to do some <a href=""https://www.elle.fr/Elle-a-Table/Les-dossiers-de-la-redaction/Dossier-de-la-redac/Tartine-salee"">tartines</a> for lunch a couple of afternoons. Given the time of year, it should be something with hits of basil and tomatoes. Though as ever either because Whole Foods has gone too downmarket or supply chains are disrupted, I have yet to encounter any amazing tomatoes.<br/>
<br/>
For my usual veggie option I&#39;m going to try doing a <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jul/22/how-to-make-spanish-omelette-tortilla-recipe-felicity-cloake"">Spanish omelette</a>. As that&#39;s mostly eggs and potatoes &mdash; and I have to turn on the oven anyway &mdash; I&#39;m tempted to do another <a href=""https://lefooding.com/fr/recettes-video-toquera/toquera-295-an-affair-with-un-chou-fleur-miznon"">Caf&eacute; Miznon-style cauliflower</a>&nbsp;to go alongside.&nbsp;It won&#39;t photograph especially well, if I had to guess. It risks being a very beige meal. If I can summon the energy, I&#39;ll give things a visual punch (and stay on theme) with a <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2019/06/romesco-sauce-recipe.html"">romesco sauce</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, the giant pile of frozen salmon in my freezer notwithstanding, I&#39;m sick of salmon at the moment. Maybe &mdash; maybe &mdash; if I can get my hands on some freshly-caught wild Alaskan king salmon I&#39;ll still buy some, but otherwise, I&#39;m looking for another fish to grace my table. As ever much depends on what I can get my hands on. I like the idea of picking up some striped bass and grilling it in the oven with a verdant slather of <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/07/best-pesto-recipe.html"">pesto</a>.<br/>
<br/>
As I&#39;ll have to buy lots of basil for the pesto anyway, I&#39;m minded to do more <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/07/basic-neapolitan-pizza-dough-recipe.html"">pizza</a>. For a little variety, I&#39;m thinking of replicating one of my favorites by tossing a giant pile of arugula on top after it comes out of the oven. It&#39;s not especially different to a normal pizza&nbsp;margherita, but I wouldn&#39;t want to give the impression that I&#39;m so unoriginal. That said, it&#39;s summer, and that to me still screams pizza.<br/>
<br/>
For something sweet, a friend is giving a group of people a walkthrough on these Swedish cardamom buns, or <a href=""https://www.fixfeastflair.com/home/2015/2/9/swedish-cardamom-rolls-kardemummabullar-recipe""><em>kardemummabullar</em></a>. It&#39;s difficult for me to really comment on them before diving in: this will be my first time trying them out. Though I do love cardamom, so I&#39;m optimistic. Perhaps next week I&#39;ll finally make my annual attempt at the white peach tart.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m always happy to hear from folks. And as ever, if you&#39;re enjoying this, please feel to share with friends.<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week 22","Hello again dear readers,<br/>
<br/>
This is coming a bit late for a variety of reasons. First, because I wanted to include some glamour shots of the&nbsp;<em>kardemummabullar</em>&nbsp;mentioned last week. Though as you&#39;ll see, my shaping technique was not up to the reference version, so glamour is maybe too strong a word. Second, because I somehow managed to cook too much food. The net result of which is that I still don&#39;t really need to go shopping for more, and I&#39;m still working through everything I made for the last week.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of which, it was yet another week of ups and downs. In a slightly exasperating way, my friendly neighborhood Whole Foods had nothing interesting at the fish counter except, as luck would have it, fresh wild-caught sockeye salmon. It was excellent, paired with the pesto.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3763018"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/fa1aaf89-783b-44bb-8d75-f28226eee334.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>In the end, I wound up making so much pesto that the romesco was unnecessary. My&nbsp;very beige but very tasty Spanish-style tortilla was very much livened up by the hit of green, not to mention the earthy-vegetal flavor of the pesto. And of course it&#39;s very hard to go wrong with the melt-in-your-mouth Miznon-style cauliflower.<br/>
<br/>
The pizza was once again very satisfying, even if it&#39;s not quite up to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6TPRxjuHJw"">Alex&#39;s standards</a>. I&#39;m not ready to take apart my oven yet, or buy one of the <a href=""https://www.breville.com/us/en/smart-oven-pizzaiolo/home.html"">new products coming on the market</a> for this purpose.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3763022"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/37605d77-1dcf-4ab7-b81d-2e9e806afb2f.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>The&nbsp;cardamom buns were delicious. My technique, however, requires a bit of work to get the elegant swirls the recipe&#39;s author (and my expert friend who gave us a lesson) achieves. My search for cardamom seeds led me to the excellent folks at <a href=""https://www.curiospice.com"">Curio Spices</a> on the other side of the river, whose products I definitely recommend. They remind me a lot of the wonderful folks at <a href=""https://laboiteny.com"">La Bo&icirc;te</a> in New York.<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3763026"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/dfe7e660-b655-424a-9e53-3d98b61167ff.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>For the week ahead, I&#39;m caught between excitement and despair. Excitement because summer is reaching its peak&nbsp;and with it&nbsp;more excellent produce may&nbsp;finally make its way onto my plate. There&#39;s also the prospect of fall around the corner with more opportunities to mix things up as I want things with a little more warmth.

For dinners, I&#39;m going to do another white bean salad of some sort. Possibly <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2020/05/white-bean-tuna-salad.html"">this one with tuna</a> from Serious Eats, perhaps with a poached egg on the side for good measure. There&#39;s a part of me that wants to mess with it more by adding some olives and green beans to make it even more of a strange remix of the salade ni&ccedil;oise.<br/>
<br/>
With summer waning, I&#39;ve suddenly become less interested in novelty and more interested in squeezing out my last opportunities to make summery dishes without feeling guilty. To that end, I&#39;m making more seafood <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/2019/09/the-secret-to-stovetop-paella-go-small.html"">paella</a>, whether you&#39;re sick of hearing about me cook rice or not. I have my fingers crossed that I don&#39;t have to buy another slab of squid this time.<br/>
<br/>
As mentioned, I managed to over-prepare for the last week, so that&#39;s really all I plan to shop for. If you&#39;re looking for another idea, I was quite seduced by the recent <a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/af024f37-a58f-4110-bd40-3fa23f8198fe"">feature on dal</a> in the Financial Times. I&#39;ve made no secret of how much I enjoy lentils. A nice dal with some good basmati rice is a real treat.<br/>
<br/>
For something sweet, my yearly peach tart attempt is going to have to wait another week. Some really excellent strawberries came across my path while I was shopping for some specialty ingredients at not Whole Foods for once. This really has become the summer of the strawberry. After so much shortcake, I&#39;m going to return to the minimalist sabl&eacute; base from <a href=""https://www.magazine-mint.fr/articles/tarte-aux-fraises-et-a-la-melisse/"">a recipe I gave a try</a> at the beginning of the season.<br/>
<br/>
As ever, I&#39;d love to hear from you if you&#39;re enjoying the newsletter, and please tell your friends, too.<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week 23","<div>Hello again,<br/>
<br/>
Every week as I begin writing this, I have to refer back to the archive to figure out what the next number in the sequence is. Doing that this time, I realized we&#39;re almost at week 26, which marks half a year since I began confinement cooking. Sadly, the prognosis for the public health situation hasn&#39;t improved much. Though I&#39;m reaching the point that in order to continue living my life, I may revive my kitchen renovation project that&#39;s been on hold.<br/>
<br/>
That may put confinement cooking itself on hold. The idea of washing dishes in the bathroom and living out of a mini-fridge doesn&#39;t much appeal to me, even compared with living on a diet of takeout. I may spend enough to have a chance to try and possibly discover the non-obvious&nbsp;benefits of the Sweetgreen VIP help line. (Because fashionable salad-bowl food can go so disastrously wrong?)&nbsp;But that&#39;s a long way off even as I begin to bring the project out of its deep freeze.<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, looking back on the week, the white bean salad was a qualified success. It&#39;s good, but lacks a certain substantialness, poached egg aside. It feels like more of a light lunch than a proper dinner main. My attempt to toss in some elements of a salade ni&ccedil;oise was also fine, but left me wanting a real one. After the peach tart, the Nice-style composed salad I had at a cool wine bar on my trip there a few years ago was definitely a highlight.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3771950"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/037e450d-36f0-4b7c-978d-9d56f384ca1b.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>My paella plans were slightly thwarted by my failure to realize that I was completely out of good stock in my freezer. I came very close to buying a jar of Better Than Bouillon&trade; when I was shopping. In the end, paying $10 for a jar of something made with yeast extracts to simulate chicken was not appealing. I used water for the paella, and it was frankly fine. Watch out for me either roasting a chicken or trying to find bulk fish parts to make some stock in the coming weeks.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3771954"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/6b8574c8-5e28-4fac-a9cd-d70346f2c6bc.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>As all the shellfish that I wanted at the fish counter were thawed from frozen anyway, I opted instead for a giant bag of frozen scallops augmented with some tapas-style smoked mussels in a fashionable tin with a pull tab. I&#39;ll come to my plans for the mass of remaining scallops&nbsp;shortly.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3771958"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/5b8158e0-ffcb-4405-ab29-85b2b61dde50.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>In the end, the strawberries that I got my hands on were frankly so good that I couldn&#39;t even be bothered to make a pastry crust or cake to go with them. A dash of alcohol and truly minimal dusting of sugar to help draw out moisture and concentrate the flavor were all it took.<br/>
<br/>
Moving to the week to come, I&#39;m more determined this time that I will make more <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/B-mF9DRpz2J/"">bao</a> for lunch. My improvised veggie mushroom filling is very close, but it still needs some extra zing to achieve greatness. I&#39;m thinking cilantro and maybe a hit of acid.<br/>
<br/>
With my giant bag of frozen scallops, I&#39;m going to try my hand at a Peruvian-style&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/07/classic-peruvian-style-fish-ceviche-recipe.html""><em>ceviche</em></a>. Or perhaps I&#39;ll use a more interesting fish if I can get my hands on something that seems worth cooking. I&#39;m going to attempt to serve that with some height-of-summer corn, assuming I like what I see when I go shopping.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also in the mood for some kind of pasta dish, so going to generate an excuse to buy a new block of parmesan cheese to do a <a href=""https://smittenkitchen.com/2019/06/simplest-spaghetti-al-limone/""><em>spaghetti al limone</em></a>. I will add that I use the recipe from the River Cafe, mentioned, but adapted in a way I cannot vouch for, on that link. It needs something else to go with it as well: I&#39;m thinking of some kind of basic tomato salad, or perhaps some bruschetta.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, in my continuing the-place-where-it&#39;s-from-is-always-hot-therefore-this-is-summery series, I&#39;m going to try my hand at a veggie curry of some sort. I&#39;m conspicuously not linking to a recipe here because I wasn&#39;t able to find something on a credible source that wasn&#39;t festooned with annoying advertisements. This <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/nov/12/vietnamese-chicken-and-lemongrass-curry-recipe-thomasina-miers"">recipe from Thomasina Miers for something completely different</a>&nbsp;seemed OK, even if it&#39;s pretty far away from what I have in mind<br/>
<br/>
This is going to be the week for the annual peach tart attempt. If I had or knew of the recipe, I&#39;d certainly share it. My backup plan is this rather <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/aug/15/liam-charles-recipe-honey-cinnamon-baked-peaches-thyme-mascarpone"">fetching preparation of grilled peaches</a> with a slightly savory herby twist.<br/>
<br/>
As ever, I&#39;d love to hear from you with ideas or thoughts, and please share with your friends!<br/>
<br/>
Until next week,<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week 24","Hello readers,<br/>
<br/>
Another week, another set of successes and failures. This comes to you a bit later than usual once again to squeeze in a chance to get a photo of my annual attempt at doing the mythical peach tart. Unfortunately I didn&#39;t buy enough peaches, so I improvised by tossing some raspberries in as filler. Complaining about it feels a little indulgent: it would happily grace the table of the dinner party that I cannot throw for the same reasons I started this newsletter. But that&#39;s not the standard: I&#39;m still not at the level of the mythical tart by the side of the road.<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3785294"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/4114a8ce-58cb-40fa-bce4-0084cf2fb846.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>As much as I love scallops and as much as I love ceviche, I&#39;m not convinced that the two concepts work that well together. It wasn&#39;t a bad combination, but neither was I completely over the moon. Next time, I&#39;ll hold out for some nice striped bass or another more ceviche-compatible fish. But it did look impressive.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3785302"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/c55f68d2-e41d-4b5a-b7a7-cd4658d4d775.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>The lemon pasta never disappoints, nor do I ever miss a chance to buy a lump of parmesan. I was also pleasantly surprised at the quality of the tomatoes I was able to get my hands on, to the extent that I regretted not also making a trip to buy some outrageously expensive aged balsamic vinegar to really set it off. Unlike the questionable watery tomato-like products sold in the winter, they had an almost jewel-like texture on the toast. It was also a great excuse to bake a loaf of bread, and honestly I could&#39;ve eaten the bruschette rubbed with a little bit of garlic without the tomato very happily.<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3785306"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/83f81242-2f94-4b70-bbf2-5399a57f99aa.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>The tofu-carrot-lemongrass curry was a bit of an experiment that didn&#39;t really succeed. The curry paste I made was too heavy on red chili to the point that the lemongrass was completely drowned out. Likewise, I think the coconut milk overpowered the more nuanced flavors that had survived. It must also be said I do like tofu, but I found myself wanting something different and more substantial &mdash; not even necessarily meat or poultry &mdash; in the dish.<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3785310"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/a63fed81-9859-4329-94d4-011f67388090.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>For the week ahead, I&#39;ve really run out of excuses: I was once again too lazy to make the bao for lunch over the last week. The mushroom filling is languishing in its exquisite deliciousness in my refrigerator. This is the week!<br/>
<br/>
Given my slightly frustrating paella experience of a few weeks ago, I have to do a <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/2017/01/the-food-lab-how-to-roast-a-butterflied-spatchcocked-chicken.html"">roast chicken</a> in the week ahead. It&#39;s been long enough I&#39;m in a roast chicken mood, and possibly more importantly, I really need to replenish my supply of seriously good <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/2014/10/how-to-make-rich-flavorful-easy-chicken-stock.html"">chicken stock</a>. I&#39;m going to make some <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2009/07/sauteed-spinach-and-yogurt-recipe.html"">saut&eacute;d spinach</a> and, since the oven will be on anyway, <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/12/the-best-roast-potatoes-ever-recipe.html"">roast some potatoes</a>. It feels a little like it&#39;s creeping into fall, but then we&#39;re creeping into the fall.<br/>
<br/>
That also sets me up nicely to do some interesting things with the leftovers. I&#39;m tempted to go down the easy path and do more <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2020/01/sheet-pan-chicken-fajitas.html"">fajitas</a>. It feels like another one of those last-gasp-of-summer dishes.<br/>
<br/>
For a veggie main, I&#39;m going down the chickpea route. It&#39;s very tempting to repeat the <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2020/05/chicken-and-dried-fig-tagine-with-pistachios-and-chickpeas.html"">fig tagine</a> form a few weeks ago, and substitute a bit of extra veg and chickpeas for the chicken. But I may also branch out and try something similar if <a href=""https://mymoorishplate.com/lemon-cauliflower-and-chickpeas-tagine/"">a little bit different</a>. That will, of course, be served with couscous. It&#39;s really a shame that I don&#39;t have any <a href=""https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016212-preserved-lemons"">preserved lemons</a>, though it&#39;s a little too last minute to get those ready for the next week.<br/>
<br/>
Going sweet, I&#39;m clinging to summer fruit. Honestly, if I see more amazing strawberries, I may simply do more <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/jul/31/how-to-make-strawberry-shortcakes-recipe"">shortcake</a>. Though it would be nice if I could get myself on something else and either do another <a href=""https://www.nigella.com/recipes/strawberry-and-almond-crumble"">crumble</a> or another <a href=""https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/fruit-galette"">galette</a>. If I&#39;m feeling especially motivated when I do my shop, I may even buy more peaches for a second run at the tart.<br/>
<br/>
As ever, I&#39;d love to hear from you if you&#39;ve got ideas or simply want to share a food concept. And please feel more than welcome to share with your friends.<br/>

Until next week,<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week 25","<div>Hello readers,<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a useful exercise to remind myself we&#39;re living through a once-in-a-century public health event. We&#39;ve now been here for about six months, and it&#39;s easy to get complacent, or, in my case, begin to really feel that frustration that so many things have had to be put on hold or been disrupted. Welcome, in other words, to September and the dregs of summer.<br/>
<br/>
The last week I kept matters alimentary estival. I wound up not making another peach tart and instead going for another blueberry crumble. It was very adequate. Perhaps there&#39;s less variance in the quality of blueberries. I did have high hopes. While there was nothing really local and completely overpriced, I was able to get my hands on some promising (and, honestly, still pretty good) blueberries from a more quality-focused operation in Qu&eacute;bec.<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3795718"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/5df3df3c-dce3-4f17-b30e-2c34019d09bd.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>With the tagine, I took the more off-the-beaten-path approach that I alluded to. I think it may have been vegan, incidentally. The cauliflower was a good addition. The vegan angle may have been its downfall, however. Or at least not doing more to combat the lack of body from something like well-seared shrimp. The whole thing was kind of thin and lacked body, even after blitzing up a few spoonfuls of the stew to try and give the sauce some heft. I may try this again at some point with more of an eye in that direction.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3795722"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/11d041f8-f147-4965-b1ca-466598de6281.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>The roast chicken and the fajitas were good. Were it not for my desperation to make some chicken stock, I might not have done the roast. When I buy any kind of animal product, I really go out of my way to buy the best and most humanely raised option possible, be that pastured-raised eggs or line-caught tuna. For all my moaning and groaning, it is nice that Whole Foods doesn&#39;t try to hide the animal welfare labels on its products.&nbsp;I usually buy chickens on level four of their animal welfare rating scheme. This time, I had to settle for level two. Animal welfare and environmental issues aside, I could taste the difference. I&#39;ve gotten so accustomed to living in my food bubble, it was somewhat disconcerting to have a mutant chicken as I was carving it after roasting.<br/>
<br/>
Brilliant planner that I am, I forgot to buy the aromatics to actually make the chicken stock with the leftover roast chicken. That will have to happen sometime in the week ahead.<br/>
<br/>
I did&nbsp;remember&nbsp;to make the bao &mdash; always a good idea &mdash; though forgot to take photos. Unlike the fajitas (not very photogenic), I&#39;m getting good at the the bao pleating, and they actually looked fairly polished. This is what happens when I&#39;m frantically making dumplings in the middle of a weekday running back and forth to my computer.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of which, the weather here remains nice enough that I can&#39;t bring myself to give up on the summery fare for the week to come.<br/>
<br/>
My copy of <a href=""http://alamaisonlelivre.com""><em>&Agrave;&nbsp;la maison</em></a> &mdash; the cookbook bringing together confinement recipes from chefs around France &mdash; finally arrived. Because the French have done a better job controlling the public health situation than we have stateside&nbsp;and the book was compiled in the height of the lockdown in the spring, many of the recipes are of that season. Though I think there are a few things that will be interesting (and season-appropriate) to try out at the border of the summer and the fall.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a pretty straightforward fusion recipe for rare tuna from the chef at <a href=""https://www.oetkercollection.com/hotels/le-bristol-paris/restaurants-bar/restaurants/epicure/"">Le Bristol</a> that I&#39;m going to give a try. It has that minimal-cooking summery character I&#39;m still in the mood for. I&#39;ll pair that with something like a seared baby bok choy and rice for good measure.<br/>
<br/>
As a veggie option, I&#39;m going to try my hand at red pesto with a <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2018/07/pesto-alla-trapanese-sicilian-pesto-with-almonds-and-tomatoes.html"">pesto alla trapanese</a> over designer spaghetti I picked up a couple of weeks ago. It seemed like a good way to take advantage of&nbsp;the tail end of tomato season. Unlike Ligurian pesto that&#39;s made with basil and pine nuts, this is made with tomatoes and blanched almonds. I may have another stab at doing an eggplant dish to go with this as I increasingly find pasta by itself a little strange.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, unless I somehow manage to get my hands on really good in-season wild-caught salmon, I&#39;m going to deplete my stockpile of frozen fish and do <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/2017/04/how-to-make-salmon-burgers.html"">salmon burgers</a>. It also gives me another chance to haul out the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOkZCTuGvs0"">burger bun recipe</a> from a couple of months ago. The starch gelling technique really works incredibly well; unless I was really in need of something convenient, I see no reason to ever buy burger buns again.<br/>
<br/>
Lunch-wise, I have it in my head to bake another nice loaf of bread and return to the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXPapdDR0ZU"">tartine</a> project. Perhaps with some smoked salmon, pickled red onion, and a light spread of cream cheese. I&#39;m not sure how summery that is, but something about the concept appeals to me.<br/>
<br/>
For something sweet, there&#39;s an interesting recipe for a fig granita also from the aforementioned cookbook that I&#39;m hoping to try out. I may have to suffer through and buy figs from California. Not that I think of the fig as especially well-suited to the New England climate, but it feels antithetical to something even if I can&#39;t quite place it.<br/>
<br/>
Much as I want the license to try more fall-inflected cooking, I&#39;m hoping summer sticks around for a few more weeks. The challenge is good. I&#39;ll be able to coast on fall classics for the first few weeks of October, I suspect. It&#39;s when I run out of ideas that things get interesting.<br/>
<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week 26","Hello again readers,<br/>
<br/>
The day has come: we have now reached week 26. For anyone less au fait with the number&#39;s significance, this marks half a year since our crisis really took hold and I started this newsletter. That I don&#39;t feel like we&#39;re anywhere near being done is, if nothing else, a reminder we&#39;re living through an exceptional moment in history.<br/>
<br/>
On a related note, a few weeks ago I mentioned dusting off my kitchen renovation project. Given I&#39;ll be stuck at home more or less indefinitely, if I wait until the public health situation improves, it may be a long wait indeed. In the last few weeks I&#39;ve been interviewing architects, and may have found someone I like enough to really get the project going. That may mean this newsletter either goes into hibernation. I may also use it to chronicle the ups and downs of living almost exclusively off takeout. If you&#39;d like to follow along on that journey, I&#39;ve resurrected <a href=""https://jkibe.github.io/kitchen145/"">a blog where you can follow along</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Moving back to food, the last week was another case of slightly flawed planning. Namely, the mutant chicken I bought wound up yielding a lot more fajita fodder than I was expecting, which wound up displacing the <em>pesto alla trapanese</em>. Fortunately it&#39;s easy to use up a couple of spare tomatoes and some herbs, so waste was minimal.<br/>
<br/>
The salmon burgers were pretty good. Not world-changing, but decent. They&#39;ll probably enter my repertoire as another one of those dishes that&#39;s easy to knock together when supplies or willpower are limited. At least my version was not especially photogenic.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3808126"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/cb81288c-16a7-4589-a4ef-61e0e436113b.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>My tuna experiment was quite a bit more successful. The quasi-marinade has a nice kick. It&#39;s also fun knowing I cooked something worthy of the chef at Le Bristol. Though I need to work on execution. The recipe suggests pouring the sauce into the hot pan after searing the tuna, and letting it marinate there for an hour. My usually raw-rare tuna steak wound up being much closer to medium-well, probably because of the residual heat. Next time, the post-sear soak will happen in a bowl well off the heat. I also took some inspiration from Kenji Lopez-Alt&#39;s <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/04/dining/stir-fry-recipe-wok-hei.html"">recent <em>Times</em> piece about wok hei</a>, and made some seared baby bok choy that was really, really good. Cleaning the pan afterwards was not especially fun &mdash; perhaps I should get a carbon steel pan or even a flat-bottomed wok &mdash; but the bok choy really was good.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3808130"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/1c89cc96-78ee-4ab4-bcfc-38ab65fe90e6.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>The smoked salmon tartine was disappointing, though for reasons due purely to my own incompetence. My Whole Foods was out of cream cheese last week. As a substitute, I bought some garlic-herb soft cheese spread. Except that rather than buy a name brand like Boursin or Rondel&eacute;, I bought the generic Whole Foods private label product. How the mighty have fallen. It&#39;s awful, and one read of the ingredient list explains why: it&#39;s not cheese! It&#39;s a strange recombined cheddar cheese product. The label proudly proclaims it&#39;s from Wisconsin, which I think gives the serious and excellent people making real cheese there a bad name. If there were an alternative to Whole Foods, I&#39;d stop shopping there tomorrow.<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3808134"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/2bf97563-2d34-4475-bc90-08de46162c30.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/><br/>
Out of ennui or lack of time, I decided to eat the figs as is with a little bit of honey rather than make the granita. In a more romantic telling, the weather lost that summer edge, and I didn&#39;t feel like eating something so cold.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to the week ahead, I&#39;ve more or less given up on clinging to summer. I don&#39;t really understand what it is about the weather in New England that does this. One week I can&#39;t step outside without baking, and the next I need a sweater. It always feels like the change should be more gradual.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll start with the sweet: I feel like I have to do something with apples. The idea of a <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/08/freeform-peach-pie-galette-recipe.html"">galette</a> appeals to a lazy part of me. The more industrious part of me wants to pick up some puff pastry and have another attempt at recreating the legendary apple tarts from <a href=""http://poilane.com"">Poil&acirc;ne</a>.<br/>
<br/>
A small part of me really wants to hunt down some&nbsp;merguez sausages and have one last summery hurrah serving those with harissa corn on the cob and couscous. I&#39;ve never really looked, though neither have I ever noticed merguez on sale at a butcher&#39;s counter. It&#39;s probably not a coincidence that my spell checker thinks &quot;merguez&quot; is misspelled.<br/>
<br/>
As a more realistic summer last hurrah, I&#39;m going to return to my favorite <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/mar/18/how-to-cook-moules-mariniere-recipe-felicity-cloake"">moules marini&egrave;re</a>. I&#39;ve extolled the joys of mussels before. If you still haven&#39;t given it a try, they&#39;re really not that hard to find or scary to cook with. The shallot-white wine sauce is a joy to mop up with fries, crusty bread, or (better still) fries&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;crusty bread.<br/>
<br/>
Keeping more with the seasonal transition, I&#39;m going to return to one of my favorite combinations: <a href=""https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/salmon-with-lentils-and-mustard-herb-butter-em-saumon-aux-lentilles-em-241768"">roasted salmon with lentils</a>. All the better because I recently received a shipment of goods from the wonderful people at <a href=""https://www.ranchogordo.com"">Rancho Gordo</a>. I&#39;m sure the people at Eden Foods are nice. Their green lentils can&#39;t hold a candle to the real Puy variety.<br/>
<br/>
As a veggie option, I&#39;m going to do a <a href=""https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/polenta-with-mushrooms"">polenta with mushrooms</a>. Something about mushrooms feels very of the upcoming season, even if I know I&#39;m going to use dried porcini and button mushrooms grown in a warehouse somewhere in Pennsylvania. Perhaps when c&egrave;pe season really comes into full force I&#39;ll hunt down some fresh ones and do an ultra-indulgent spaghetti with fresh porcini.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to throw together a nice <a href=""https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/pasta-e-fagioli"">pasta and bean soup</a> for lunch. Partly because it&#39;s a favorite soup, though partly because I have several kilos of dried beans to use up. At the risk of this turning into an unpaid sponsorship, the Rancho Gordo beans really are good. I have high hopes: there are the excellent beans and I have a large reserve of really good chicken stock.<br/>
<br/>
As usual, I&#39;d love your feedback, and please share with your friends if you&#39;re enjoying this.<br/>
<br/>
Until next week,<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week 27","Hello readers,<br/>
<br/>
I find myself in a strange whirlwind of optimism and something only a shade removed from despair. On a more personal level, I&#39;m increasingly optimistic that my decision to engage an architectural practice was the right one. I&#39;ll have more to say on that soon.&nbsp;Suffice to say my creative juices are flowing. I&#39;ll be putting most of that story on my <a href=""https://jkibe.github.io/kitchen145/"">ad hoc renovation blog</a>.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, the writers penning the year 2020 really are hacks. I&#39;m going to seriously deviate from the usual content&nbsp;to encourage you to participate in the political process. The act of voting is great. Getting more involved is even better. If you&#39;re young and can find the time, consider canvassing or volunteering as poll worker to make participating easier for others.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also going to recommend some political philosophy. Yascha Mounk&#39;s&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674545465""><em>The Age of Responsibility</em></a>&nbsp;changed my worldview more than perhaps any book I&#39;ve read in the last decade. David Wootton&#39;s <a href=""https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674976672""><em>Power, Pleasure, and Profit</em></a>&nbsp;helps us understand how we got here.&nbsp;My current project is Michael Sandel&#39;s <a href=""https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374289980""><em>The Tyranny of Merit</em></a>, in a similar vein. He and two other thinkers <a href=""https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000mbhq"">took on this topic</a> on <em>Start the Week</em>&nbsp;recently.&nbsp;I may despair at the populist shift. That more than any policy threat is what keeps me up at night. We&#39;ll only make it worse if we don&#39;t acknowledge the legitimacy of its grievances and anxieties.<br/>
<br/>
Holding everything together, there is food. This change of seasons has been a welcome change for my menu planning.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3818362"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/4b696be5-bf33-451f-8a8f-73045515daf5.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>It was an excellent excuse to make more mussels. The moules marini&egrave;re is such a simple recipe, it&#39;s difficult to mess up. Nor is the end of summer really any reason to stop eating mussels. But it demands a slight change of tack: richer, warmer flavors. Watch this space for a fish stew at some point as we leave summer further behind.<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3818354"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/1f101f21-0dc3-4c8e-8d6f-a459829e6f94.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>The salmon with lentils was a more overt acknowledgement of fall&#39;s arrival. That too is difficult to really mess up. Though it&#39;s one of those dishes whose simplicity underscores the need for good ingredients. None of that weird farmed salmon from Norway. None of those imposter lentils whose color is the only similarity with the good stuff of the Puy variety.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3818358"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/52396255-9081-4963-ae26-0984b8f2c9ec.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>Likewise, the other projects had a certain simplicity. The polenta with mushrooms really depends on the quality of the polenta and the mushrooms. My pasta and bean soup was infinitely enhanced with the wonders of Rancho Gordo beans.&nbsp;Cultured butter makes all the difference in a simple apple galette.<br/>
<br/>
For the week to come, the theme continues to be liminal.<br/>
<br/>
Once again in an effort to deplete my immense stock of dried beans, I&#39;m going to do one of my other favorite soups: <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/01/rick-baylesss-black-bean-soup-recipe.html"">black bean</a>. More than any other soup I can think of, truly great black beans really do make all the difference. The quality and richness of the cooking liquor is the difference between ho-hum and spectacular. On the one hand, it&#39;s soup with all of its cold weather warming properties. On the other hand, it makes me think of Mexican cooking and warm weather.<br/>
<br/>
Staying in that region, I&#39;m going to do some kind of <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/12/enchiladas-suizas-rick-bayless-recipe.html"">enchiladas</a>. If I can muster the willpower to hunt down the right chilis (admittedly pretty unlikely), the idea of finally trying my hand at a true <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/10/mole-poblano-recipe-how-to-make-mole.html"">mole</a> really appeals to me. More realistically, I&#39;ll probably do something predictable and dull like a basic <a href=""https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018153-chicken-enchiladas-with-salsa-verde"">enchiladas verdes</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Shifting more towards temperate climates and a more autumnal feeling, I&#39;m going to venture into one of my few approved British dishes, <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/2017/07/how-to-make-english-british-fish-pie.html"">fish pie</a>. It&#39;s really a winning formula. There&#39;s the rich cream sauce, the flaky fish, and the topping of buttery mashed potatoes. I&#39;ll probably balance it out with some kind of autumn-winter squash. It&#39;s a little incongruous. A handful of peas in the pie does not a balanced meal make, however.<br/>
<br/>
Returning to the bean theme, I&#39;m going to round things out with another Yotam recipe: <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jul/11/yotam-ottolenghi-chickpea-recipes-confit-tandoori-polenta-chips-parmesan-braise"">confit chickpeas</a>. I&#39;m not really sure what season these belong to. The perils of borrowing from a tradition that grew out of a tropical part of the world without temperate climate seasons. I&#39;ll tell myself that steaming is very warming and cozy when I make the rice.<br/>
<br/>
For something sweet, I can&#39;t quite give up on fruit desserts. The really indulgent chocolate cakes have to wait for the dead of winter. In that line of thinking, I&#39;m going to revive an old favorite and do a raspberry <a href=""https://www.nigella.com/recipes/lemon-polenta-cake"">polenta cake</a>. It&#39;s made with enough butter, maybe I can convince myself it&#39;s not so summery after all.<br/>
<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week 28","Hello readers,<br/>
<br/>
I have had a bit of a rough week. Without getting into too much detail, I need to do a better job saying &quot;no&quot; to projects. As it relates to this newsletter, this has meant a bit more takeout than usual. This seems important to share. Putting aside the relatively small amount of work that goes into writing and taking photos for this, all this cooking does require time and energy as well as skill. Sometimes it&#39;s not feasible, and I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with that. For the same reason &mdash; at least before it became a lot harder to eat out &mdash; I had been becoming a lot more comfortable with the idea that restaurants didn&#39;t have to dazzle me. Sometimes you need a night off, however calming mechanically stirring a risotto may be.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3830494"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/8b187e90-d4cb-4e01-811e-51cfede56a66.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>That said, I did whip up some reasonable enchiladas. I definitely didn&#39;t have the time to make a mole, and also couldn&#39;t find tomatillos to do enchiladas verdes. Not that tomato-based enchiladas are really that disappointing.&nbsp;Keeping with what I think of as a Mexican (or perhaps Tex-Mex) theme, I also did wind up throwing together the black bean soup.<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3830498"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/80b9a68f-0f92-48e8-9c40-e151f8148ae4.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>For anyone in my neck of the woods, I did at least have some fun in my exhaustion and tried out Oisa Ramen. The soup suffered from being transported in a plastic container for 20 minutes. It was only really acceptable, not amazing, though I&#39;m slightly reserving judgement for the day when I&#39;m able to try their fare at its peak at the noodle bar.<br/>
<br/>
The week ahead, then, is somewhat dictated by the week that&#39;s passed. I&#39;d still like to catch up and do what I missed out on due to some flavor of exhaustion.<br/>
<br/>
That begins with a <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/2017/07/how-to-make-english-british-fish-pie.html"">fish pie</a>. My motivations remain the same, perhaps underscored by the weather giving us its final gasp of summer and really settling into fall. Cream sauce and mashed potatoes are pretty great.<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, I&#39;m really eager to try out the Ottolenghi recipe for <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jul/11/yotam-ottolenghi-chickpea-recipes-confit-tandoori-polenta-chips-parmesan-braise"">confit chickpeas</a> that I linked to last week. I&#39;m so eager that I bought some boutique pita bread from the fine people at Clover Food Lab. Much to my amazement, I was unable to find even boring pita bread at my local Whole Foods. I never completely rule out having not found it in their labyrinthine aisles, but it also feeds my Jeff Bezos ruined Whole Foods narrative.<br/>
<br/>
For a third menu, I&#39;m going to continue depleting my apparently bottomless supply of frozen salmon by doing a <a href=""https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/harissa-roast-salmon-lemon-chickpea-couscous"">roasted salmon with harissa</a>. It has a little bit of a North African feel that maybe isn&#39;t too seasonal, but I need to do something new. In more of a nod to the season, I&#39;ll probably pair that with <a href=""https://www.thekitchn.com/roasted-carrots-262010"">carrots</a> blasted with heat from a hot oven. I like them almost overcooked, with a nice bit of char on the outside, and so much moisture cooked out the flavor is super-concentrated and they melt in the mouth.<br/>
<br/>
For a sweet, I&#39;m going to return to the <a href=""https://www.nigella.com/recipes/lemon-polenta-cake"">raspberry polenta cake</a> that I didn&#39;t get around to either.<br/>
<br/>
With any luck, October should be a little smoother, and my food-wise creativity will have a little more space to run. It will probably be the last gasp for home cooking before the construction crew descends and my kitchen turns into, at least initially, a pile of dust.<br/>
<br/>
As ever, I&#39;d love to hear from you, and please feel free to share this with your friends.<br/>
<br/>
Until next week,<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week 29","Hello readers,<br/>
<br/>
I come to you this week calmed and much more refreshed. The cooking has been back to its usual tempo, and I have my usual triumphs and failures.<br/>
<br/>
From a more macro perspective, the clock is now ticking for either a hiatus or slight subject change for this newsletter. On Friday I signed the paperwork with an architectural practice to get my kitchen project started. I&#39;ll have more to say about that <a href=""https://jkibe.github.io/kitchen145/"">elsewhere at some point</a>. I&#39;m still not sure how I&#39;m going to work around that. It&#39;s very possible I&#39;ll spend enough at Sweetgreen to find out what it&#39;s like to have access to their concierge service for loyal customers. The mystery of what benefit that could possibly provide is almost motivation enough by itself.<br/>
<br/>
The week that&#39;s been began with the confit chickpeas. The Rancho Gordo chickpeas are fantastic. The confit chickpeas are also good. They are not, however, sufficient for anything other than maybe a light lunch. It felt like more of a part of a good mezze spread than something that could hold its own as the true center of a feast.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3844206"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/3f24c9f2-f3f3-4dc9-9e02-d73df2820c67.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>Harissa continues to be one of my favorite things. It almost seems like a cheat to suggest it as a recipe addition, given how excellent it is, in this case slathered on some salmon. My fish pie was a little less successful. I couldn&#39;t get the mash on top to catch for those crispy peaks &mdash; possibly I should&#39;ve used a piping bag &mdash; and it bled a little too much into the sauce and seafood below. On the other hand, it was still pretty tasty.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3844218"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/b6a97b61-4840-41a7-88c5-98e40e78bf46.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>Looking to the week ahead, I wound up making so much fish pie that I should have lunch covered for the next few days. For anyone looking for an idea, I will once again make the recommendation for <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AX2rpC2BFK4"">a nice tartine</a>.<br/>
<br/>
On a whim I tried a carrot-blueberry muffin from my friends at Clover Food Lab a few weeks ago. I&#39;m a convert. So why not have a try at making my own? There are a few places where the Clover muffins don&#39;t quite work for me. The strussel-esque topping is too easy to delaminate from the &quot;body&quot; of the muffin. It&#39;s been frustrating trying to find <a href=""https://topwithcinnamon.com/blueberry-carrot-muffins/"">a recipe as a jumping off point</a>. Predictably, this formula is a big hit with the dubious health benefits brigade. All I care about is getting that super moist crumb.<br/>
<br/>
Heading savory, I&#39;m going to drag out the classic <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/12/basic-ragu-bolognese-recipe.html"">rag&ugrave; bolognese</a> for a pasta outing. At this point, I&#39;ve entered Italian grandmother territory. I make it by feel more than anything. As ever, I feel the need to eat something more than only pasta as a meal. I&#39;ll probably throw together a light salad. Possibly something with <a href=""https://www.thekitchn.com/recipe-simple-arugula-salad-254833"">arugula and shaved parmesan</a>.<br/>
<br/>
In my continuing effort to work through my stockpile of beans, I&#39;m going to have a run at making <a href=""https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/chorizo-and-gigante-bean-cassoulet-394692"">cassoulet</a>. I slightly worry that I&#39;m embracing the cold weather a little too aggressively. And I know I&#39;m offending someone in Toulouse by even contemplating the omission of confit duck or adding Spanish sausage.<br/>
<br/>
For a veggie option, I&#39;m going to do <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/sep/28/jamie-oliver-easy-vegetarian-recipes-cauliflower-katsu-mushroom-stroganoff-cottage-pie-pasta-fagioli-soup"">cauliflower katsu</a>, though possibly not follow the Jamie Oliver recipe to the letter. I&#39;m not sure which season this corresponds to exactly, but it seemed like an interesting twist on something I usually do with chicken or pork, without lapsing into too much meat fakery.<br/>
<br/>
Given I&#39;m making muffins and probably doing a big bread bake to go with the cassoulet, I wasn&#39;t planning to make anything sweet. If you&#39;re looking for something, the chocolate-ginger cookies in the latest <a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/2a665e67-7f25-4b15-9ef8-f1df79a37aa5"">Honey and Co recipe in the FT</a> looked pretty tasty.<br/>
<br/>
As usual, I&#39;d love to hear from you if you&#39;re doing something interesting or have a piece of feedback. And please feel free to share this with friends if you&#39;re enjoying it.<br/>
<br/>
Until next week,<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week 30","Hello readers,<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s still not a particularly firm date for the beginning of my&nbsp;cooking hiatus. I suspect it&#39;s going to take at least another few months before the construction team moves in and my tiny apartment is turned into a cloud of dust.<br/>
<br/>
My transition to fall has been a little rocky food-wise. I can do a rag&ugrave; in my sleep in this point. It&#39;s always satisfying, if not particularly stimulating from a variety or originality perspective. Whereas&nbsp;my more experimental takes were edible, if disappointing.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3854486"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/9e54843e-95ef-4c26-8f17-d9d089cf206c.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>The carrot muffins looked a little sad: I should have portioned larger amounts of batter. More importantly, they were a little flat in terms of their seasoning. I didn&#39;t have any dates on hand (as called for in my starting point recipe), so the muffins lacked the sweetness those would have provided. They also could have used some lemon zest and a pinch of salt. But they were headed in the right direction. A second attempt, and I think I&#39;d get them more or less right.<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3854490"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/79fecb8a-39f9-4dbb-bc23-d40c8257c4ae.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>Meanwhile, the riff on cassoulet was close to an unmitigated disaster. The beans were fantastic, and that&#39;s about it. It was otherwise a red-grey slick of grease. While I&#39;m not a cassoulet expert, I&#39;ve had it often enough at restaurants to know that it can be superb, and this was not. This is much the way with these traditional French dishes. I&#39;ve had similar experiences with quenelles: mine are pretty mediocre, whereas I had a superbly executed example at a neighborhood restaurant in Lyon earlier in the year. It&#39;s not light food, nor should it be. The trick is getting something rich to taste etherial.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll have to report back later on the cauliflower katsu. I haven&#39;t had a chance to try that out yet. Perhaps it will be the culinary savior of this week when I get to whip it up.<br/>
<br/>
Looking toward the week to come, I won&#39;t give up on the carrot-blueberry muffins. A second attempt should give me a nice breakfast treat, and I think I can get the smaller details right a second time around.<br/>
<br/>
For lunches, it&#39;s back to tartines. I&#39;m thinking of doing a veggie riff on one of my usual favorites, a <a href=""https://food52.com/recipes/80769-spicier-curry-chicken-salad"">curried chicken salad</a>. Given everything kind of gets turned into a paste anyway to be tartine-compatible, I think it might be possible to get away with swapping in some wonderfully creamy chickpeas.<br/>
<br/>
Moving to the evenings, I&#39;m thinking of doing a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlsEkjy_pFI"">Sicilian-style fish stew</a> as the weather begins to really transition into something autumnal. The rich tomatoey warmth with the tender fish is really quite nice. Probably paired with either bread or wet polenta, and a simple green salad much like the one from last week.<br/>
<br/>
Staying with my inadvertent Italian theme, I&#39;m going to try out the latest in Felicity Cloake&#39;s&nbsp;<em>Perfect</em>&nbsp;series with <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/sep/30/how-to-make-the-perfect-pasta-ai-funghi-recipe-felicity-cloake"">her take on pasta with mushrooms</a>. The idea of whizzing up the dried porcini to make a paste and therefore intensity their flavor is a curious one that I could see working very well.<br/>
<br/>
Not satisfied with something katsu-esque once in two weeks (or indeed two <em>Guardian</em> recipes in one), I&#39;m also intrigued by the latest Ottolenghi recipe for a <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/oct/10/yotam-ottolenghi-recipes-for-autumn-traybakes"">curried butternut squash gratin</a>. He suggests pairing it with a green vegetable. I&#39;m very tempted to be lazy and blast some broccoli with heat in the already-hot oven. Only a question of adding some slivered garlic, salt, olive oil, and a dash of lemon zest after it comes out of the oven.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m tempted to skip a sweet for this week for a change. I love cake as much as the next person, but it&#39;s almost like I need to clear my dessert palate to move into the slightly richer cold-weather dessert genre. If I do wind up doing a sweet &mdash; not something to be ruled out entirely &mdash; it will probably be the Christian Constant chocolate mousse from <a href=""https://alamaisonlelivre.com""><em>&Agrave; la maison</em></a>.

"Confinement Cooking, Week 31","Hello readers,<br/>
<br/>
Next week I should have slightly more to say about the kitchen. For now, the end date for the 1980s kitchen will continue looming as a very exciting and expensive unknown.<br/>
<br/>
In other news, I&#39;m not making any of the recipes, but it&#39;s worth nothing &mdash; purely for the quality of the prose &mdash; that Nigella Lawson has a small sampling of <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/oct/17/nigella-lawson-new-favourite-comfort-food-recipes"">recipes from her&nbsp;new cookbook</a> in this weekend&#39;s <em>Observer</em>. My copy of the new book, <a href=""https://www.waterstones.com/book/cook-eat-repeat/nigella-lawson/9781784743666""><em>Cook, Eat, Repeat</em></a>,&nbsp;should arrive around its publication date at the end of the month. It promises to be much more like her first book,&nbsp;<em>How to Cook</em>, which has an excellent prose-recipe ratio. I do love her <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBvLDOux-9o"">chocolate cake recipe</a>, but otherwise I genuinely buy the books for the writing.<br/>
<br/>
Returning to last week,&nbsp;I finally made the cauliflower katsu. It was in some ways a success, in others, not so much. The sauce I made was very close to something great. I like ginger a lot.&nbsp;I added a bit too much in this case: the curry powder was somewhat overpowered. On the other hand, much as I like cauliflower, in this application I found myself wanting a slab or pork or a chicken breast. There&#39;s something too insubstantial about a slab of cauliflower as a main course.<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3865982"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/ebbc6d9f-d80b-4146-82cf-30ed04a625fb.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>Meanwhile, I&#39;m a big fan of the Felicity Cloake take on pasta with mushrooms. The mirepoix adds some heft and complexity, and the porcini powder is genius. It&#39;s like an amplifier for the woody umami of the otherwise slightly flat chestnut mushrooms.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3865986"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/15721f80-fc00-4cef-9c04-d73c56154f13.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>My feelings about the butternut squash gratin mirror my feelings about the confit chickpeas: delicious, though too light to be a standalone main. The gratin might work better with a bigger, chunkier&nbsp;salad than my delicate assemblage of arugula.<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3865990"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/e3dc2a25-8852-4d04-bc77-e2fdd4cd0b56.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>For the week to come, I&#39;ll start with the sweet. Or perhaps sweets. Between the weather cooling down and my impending kitchen project, I&#39;ve decided now is the moment to have another run at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50-yxbahn5I"">doing croissants</a>. Unless there&#39;s a magical French bakery opening soon near me, DIY remains my best option&nbsp;with travel still restricted, and that door may soon close as well when my&nbsp;kitchen is torn apart.<br/>
<br/>
​Those are a weekend breakfast treat, though.&nbsp;For a more dessert dessert, I&#39;m going to try doing an <a href=""https://food52.com/recipes/26709-maialino-s-olive-oil-cake"">olive oil cake</a>. There&#39;s a lot of scope for noodling around. I like the idea of a&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.gastronomixs.com/en/components/orange-confit"">confit orange</a> and rosewater topping, though we&#39;ll have to see what my reserves of willpower are like.<br/>
<br/>
Going savory, I need to deplete my giant stock of frozen fish. Something about the idea of a <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/2020/01/rice-bowl-how-to.html"">donburi</a> appeals, so I&#39;m thinking of doing a sushi rice bowl with salmon, probably blasted with heat under the grill in my oven.<br/>
<br/>
As a veggie option, I&#39;m taking inspiration from&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.frenchie-ruedunil.com"">Frenchie</a> and doing the heretical: making <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2015/03/light-tender-potato-gnocchi-recipe.html"">gnocchi</a>&nbsp;(with mushrooms) as a veggie&nbsp;main course. Perhaps this proves that for all my forays into Italian cooking, I&#39;m less an Italian at heart than someone who likes Italian food viewed through other culinary prisms.&nbsp;<span style=""caret-color: rgb(85, 85, 85); color: rgb(85, 85, 85); font-size: 16px; font-style: normal;"">It will&nbsp;also give me another opportunity to riff on the excellent mushroom pasta&nbsp;from the last week.</span><br/>
<br/>
Finally, I&#39;m in the mood for a roast chicken, though I&#39;m giving it a bit of a twist. As nonsensical as it feels, I want the warm (dare I say summery) heat of the Maghreb, so I&#39;m planning to try doing a <a href=""https://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/chicken-recipes/harissa-chicken-traybake/"">roast with&nbsp;harissa</a> and a chili sauce. I&#39;m suffering from squash overload after the gratin, though squash and harissa are also an excellent combination.&nbsp;I&#39;ll probably garnish the chicken&nbsp;with roast potatoes and perhaps some braised kale or saut&eacute;d spinach.<br/>
<br/>
Per usual, I&#39;d love to hear from you if you&#39;re enjoying this or have other ideas, and please feel free to share with your friends.<br/>
<br/>
Until next week,<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week 32","Hello readers,<br/>
<br/>
It hasn&#39;t quite sunk in yet, but my kitchen project is now well and truly underway. I&#39;ll keep writing about that from time to time on my <a href=""https://jkibe.github.io/kitchen145/step-one"">mini-blog that I set up</a> to chart its progress. As concerns this newsletter, my impression is that a lot of the timeline is going to be driven by how much money I want to spend on cabinets. If I go with pure Ikea, there&#39;s effectively zero wait time. At the other extreme of the price scale, if I go Poggenpohl it could be months before the cabinets make an appearance and can be installed. Apparently all the construction manufacturers are way behind due to the pandemic as well, only adding to the logistical challenges of getting a kitchen imported from Germany.<br/>
<br/>
I may also have a brief hiatus around Christmas as my plans evolve. Though in the spirit of a cooking TV series, I may do a&nbsp;Christmas ideas special issue. Otherwise, I plan to keep this going until either construction or a huge public health improvement creates more of a change.<br/>
<br/>
As for the week that&#39;s been, I once again overshot, and made more food than I thought I would. So I still haven&#39;t made the gnocchi. The croissants are in progress, though not quite ready for my self-imposed (and admittedly totally arbitrary) publication deadline. So a progress report there and the accompanying photos will have to wait for next week.<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3877374"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/5704a7b7-76e2-4b1d-b6ad-8eb5417a9d31.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>The harissa-inflected roast chicken was very ho-hum. It has potential but needs work. Most notably, I should have ignored the recipe&#39;s suggestion and roasted closer to 450 &deg;F than his 350 &deg;F suggestion. There was a distinct lack of roast-ness.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3877378"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/d65ea94e-f10e-4833-8577-c3c40cd3f865.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>Meanwhile, the miso salmon continues to be a winner. It&#39;s so simple, and so good. The donburi concept was also a good one, even if I found the Whole Foods own brand sushi rice a little disappointing. I want to blame Amazon, but I&#39;m not sure Whole Foods was ever a great source for Japanese ingredients. Perhaps I will have to journey to an Asian supermarket and see if I can do better.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3877382"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/a80216d4-4830-4673-9cd7-5da6f2fe69a0.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>For the week to come, I&#39;ll start this week with the veggie option. After the last few attempts to do one big veggie main, I&#39;m going to try and learn my lesson. The lovely people at Clover Food Lab continue to sell bags of their excellent pita, which feels very appropriate as a mezze foundation. I&#39;ll pair that with <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/oct/17/from-dal-to-butter-beans-yotam-ottolenghi-legumes-recipes"">another Ottolenghi bean recipe</a>, some roasted cauliflower, and (riffing on my Middle East-by-way-of-London theme) some <a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/ede13012-67b3-11e5-97d0-1456a776a4f5"">grilled eggplant</a>.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also planning to draw down my still enormous supply of frozen fish, and do some <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2013/02/smoked-salmon-and-cod-cakes.html"">salmon cakes</a>. I still have some leftover katsu curry sauce that might add a nice bit of zing there. I tend to think of fish cakes as a starter rather than a main, but I&#39;m looking for variety, and I think if they&#39;re paired with an interesting side, they&#39;ll be enough. I&#39;m thinking of borrowing from one of my favorite dishes and serving these with lentils.<br/>
<br/>
As I still need to go through the gnocchi, that&#39;s all I&#39;m planning to do. For another idea, I&#39;d suggest doing a <a href=""https://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/rice-recipes/roast-squash-sage-chestnut-and-pancetta-risotto/"">pumpkin risotto</a>. It&#39;s a great concept, even if most of the search results on Google completely ruin the concept. An actual eating pumpkin would be great. If not, butternut squash is also a good option. In any case, run&nbsp;away from anyone who suggests using a can of pumpkin pur&eacute;e.<br/>
<br/>
For a sweet, I&#39;m finally accepting that it&#39;s no longer the summer. This <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/oct/10/benjamina-ebuehi-recipe-for-tahini-cake-with-coffee-caramel"">tahini cake with coffee caramel</a> looks fantastic.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll end with the usual appeal. It&#39;s always fun to hear from you if you&#39;re enjoying this (or indeed if you have any less positive comments), and I&#39;d encourage you to share with friends.<br/>
<br/>
Until next week,<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week 33","Hello readers,<br/>
<br/>
Without compromising my <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_security"">op-sec</a> too much, I have booked some travel for the end of the year. Unless construction starts sooner &mdash; which I really doubt will happen at this point &mdash; the final 2020 installment of this newsletter will be either the weekend of the 6th or 13th of December, depending on my willpower to put together a Christmas edition. It should resume again in early January, by which time, who knows, perhaps we&#39;ll be back into a stricter lockdown and I won&#39;t even be able to have takeout lunches.<br/>
<br/>
My latest attempt at croissants was definitely an improvement. I was a lot more rigorous about the precision of the slab of butter, and I decided to only do six at a time to make it easier to apply even pressure to the dough. But I&#39;m still a long way off where I&#39;d like to be. The lamination was a little bit uneven, and the croissants were a little bit misshapen.<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3878782"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/0128cfbd-0282-46ed-a760-659e05e467c9.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>I&#39;ve fallen so behind, the report on the DIY mezze and the very promising tahini caramel cake will have to wait for next week. I still haven&#39;t quite gotten the gnocchi right. It&#39;s a question of feel, I suspect. Less in the texture or flavor per se as much as getting each little pillow roughly the same size so they cook more evenly. This batch (or at least my attempts at capturing it with a camera) did not meet the quality level needed for inclusion here.<br/>
<br/>
The salmon cakes were surpassingly good. They were a little generic, however. I&#39;m not sure exactly what they need, but they definitely need something to give them a bit more zing and complexity.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3890474"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/031f2da7-b23d-4f08-bc22-dc9cc70bb891.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>Moving into the week to come, with the first (brief) hit of snow in the last few days, I&#39;m beginning to really embrace the chillier weather. In that vein, I&#39;m thinking of doing more of my favorite <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2015/03/pasta-e-fagioli-italian-bean-pasta-soup-recipe.html"">pasta and bean soup</a> as a good lunch option. As ever, I&#39;d highly recommend getting some <a href=""https://www.ranchogordo.com"">really good beans</a>. They&#39;re not all that expensive, and they make a huge difference.<br/>
<br/>
Dinner-wise, I&#39;m in the mood to do a low and slow braise. I have in mind something basic: <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2015/02/coq-au-vin-chicken-red-wine-braise-recipe.html"">chicken in red wine with aromatic vegetables</a>. I do like to give it a twist and serve with polenta and separately roasted root vegetables, however. I&#39;m also definitely not making a classic coq au vin, whatever the link may indicate. I like my braise lighter and to taste more of chicken, thyme, and red wine than smoked bacon.<br/>
<br/>
As a veggie option &mdash; and going to a completely different part of the world where winter is perhaps less of a concept &mdash; I&#39;m going to do a classic <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/04/channa-masala-recipe.html"">channa masala</a>. Here again: get good dried chickpeas. I&#39;ll probably serve that with garlicky spinach and (of course) rice.<br/>
<br/>
Much as a I want to continue depleting my seemingly endless supply of frozen salmon, I&#39;m going to shift gears ever so slightly for the week to come, and instead do a white fish. Which one, I&#39;m not entirely sure yet. If the food gods are with me, I&#39;d get something like a nice striped bass. If not, I may have to settle for the more prosaic cod. In any event, I&#39;ll enrobe the gently roasted fish with a huge dollop of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMOWx-qm260"">salsa verde</a>. It&#39;s debatable how autumnal or winter it is, but I haven&#39;t done a nice salsa verde in at least a few months. People may think I&#39;m a bottomless well of energy; in reality, now that I have literally recorded every home-cooked dinner for the last seven months, I honestly can&#39;t bring myself to look up the last time I did one.<br/>
<br/>
For a sweet, I&#39;m a little torn. Part of me wants to take another run at the <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2019/04/olive-oil-cake-recipe.html"">olive oil cake</a> concept. It was within striking distance of greatness. I managed to get my hands on some good blood oranges recently, and a blood orange confit appeals. On the other hand, I now have a ton of tahini, and there&#39;s only so much hummus I can eat. It&#39;s also very good in a <a href=""https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018055-salted-tahini-chocolate-chip-cookies"">chocolate chip cookie</a>. We shall see.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s always great to hear from people if you&#39;d like to drop me a line, and feel free to share this with your friends.<br/>

<br/>
That out of the way, let&#39;s return to why (I hope) people read this.<br/>
<br/>
My copy of the <a href=""https://www.waterstones.com/book/cook-eat-repeat/nigella-lawson/9781784743666"">new Nigella Lawson book</a> finally made its way to me from Blighty. I cannot recommend it highly enough. It&#39;s filled with the usual wit and witticism, with a few promising-looking recipes buried in between. Who else would compare celeriac to an albino coconut? I maintain my position that Nigella is not appreciated enough for her prose.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3895766"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/ea988ee7-5912-4ffa-a1df-e59def3a823c.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>Moving right along, as it turns out, I forgot to buy cream for the coffee caramel-inflected tahini cake of two weeks ago. Especially as cases of COVID-19&nbsp;continue to rise rapidly, I can&#39;t permit myself another trip for something so trivial.&nbsp;I wound up combining two ideas and pairing the tahini cake with a batch of confit blood orange peel instead. It&#39;s a good combination, even if I&#39;m slightly dubious about the tahini really bringing anything to the preparation. When I&#39;ve used all the peel, the leftover orange syrup is ripe for an appearance in a cocktail or on my signature Sunday morning pancakes.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3895770"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/f831b297-6e0d-454f-9077-64301020f526.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>The mini-mezze extravaganza was extremely adequate. Nothing about it blew my mind, yet it was hard to fault. Oil poaching butter beans is a great concept.<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3895774"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/c68de054-7e18-4364-9458-b8bad90d2392.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/><img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3895778"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/0d60db74-0584-4003-8cd7-e8964448d946.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>On a more positive note, the grumpy fishmonger at Whole Foods notwithstanding, I was able to get my hands on some striped bass. A few minutes under the broiler and coated with salsa verde, it was a glorious thing.<br/>
<br/>
The chicken braise hasn&#39;t quite happened yet, as is becoming a minor theme here. The weather decided to enter a freakish warm spell, undermining the coziness a nice red wine braise was meant to give. I also decided this was probably the last&nbsp;weekend&nbsp;to run outside without gobs of thermal clothing and biting wind until next year. As is my way, I slightly overdid it, which turned Saturday&nbsp;evening into more of a moan-and-recover-from-the-pain situation than my intended slow potter to braise some chicken in red wine.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll start with the sweet again for the week to come. My cant is to the gingerbread recipe in <a href=""https://www.waterstones.com/book/cook-eat-repeat/nigella-lawson/9781784743666""><i>Cook, Eat, Repeat</i></a>. It&#39;s filed away in the Christmas chapter of the book, and so I worry&nbsp;I&#39;m jumping the gun. On the other hand, the last however many months have made time feel like a very loose concept.<br/>
<br/>
For a veggie option, I&#39;m returning to a classic and doing a nice pizza. I recommend <a href=""https://recipes.oregonlive.com/recipes/saturday-pizza-dough"">the dough from one of my favorite pizza places</a>. Seasonal? I don&#39;t know. But I definitely feel a lot less guilty blasting the oven when the warmth is welcome. The more straightforward nod to the season will be some combination of roasted vegetables, taking further advantage of all that heat.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m ready to return to the soy-lime seared tuna from another recent cookbook purchase, <a href=""https://alamaisonlelivre.com""><i>&Agrave; la maison</i></a>. My bottomless cache of frozen fish contains enough tuna that I need to use some of it up.&nbsp;Incidentally, for the avant-garde French-speaking cookbook enthusiast&nbsp;in your life, the same team has a new book, <em>Cuites</em>, available for preorder.<br/>
<br/>
The seafood theme, such as it is, concludes with a <a href=""https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/arid-20329423.html"">prawn tagine</a>. Once again, it&#39;s inspired by the excellent people at <a href=""https://honeyandco.co.uk"">Honey &amp; Co</a> in London. The idea of adding cardamom in a savory dish is novel. Maybe it will be a disaster. I think it&#39;s worth trying at least once. My couscous supply has run out, and it remains mysteriously absent from store shelves,&nbsp;so I may have to serve this with rice.<br/>
<br/>
As ever, I&#39;d love to hear from you if you&#39;re enjoying this (or not!), and please feel free to forward and share. Writing this every week has really embedded itself in my &quot;new normal,&quot; so I&#39;ll probably keep doing it no matter what for my own sanity. Not that having an audience isn&#39;t at least a little bit of an inducement.<br/>
<br/>
Until next week,<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week 35","<div>Hello readers,<br/>
<br/>
Progress is slowly creeping along in my more meta project to <a href=""https://jkibe.github.io/kitchen145/"">renovate my kitchen</a>. As it turns out, getting cabinets from one of the high-end German manufacturers is pretty expensive. In a couple of cases, breathtakingly so. In a couple of others, if I had a slightly more generous budget, I might have gone for them. As it stands, I think something flatpack is in my future.<br/>
<br/>
Food-wise, the last week has been reasonably successful. I still wouldn&#39;t say I have the pizza process completely to my liking, but it&#39;s hardly disappointing. In the end, I paired the pizza&nbsp;with more of the Honey &amp; Co tahini-crusted eggplant to use up my&nbsp;tahini crust material. I feel slightly guilty blasting the eggplant with so much&nbsp;heat it melts into nothing. On the other hand, the tahini crust really is delicious.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3911914"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/fca2d494-07cd-4e1e-9359-9d54a42ba99a.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>My second run at the seared tuna from Le Bristol was closer to what I&#39;d like, though still not quite there. I need to get the pan even hotter. I&#39;m also thinking the fish should be marinated before searing rather than after. The level of rareness was right. The uniform lukewarm temperature was not. I think it would be better if the outside were piping hot to contrast with the cool rare ruby interior.<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3911910"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/7ef7830e-c504-47cd-b1fd-108ce155740d.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>In the end, I couldn&#39;t&nbsp;get my hands on golden syrup to make the Nigella gingerbread. My sweet for the week was another run at the olive oil cake. This second attempt was better. There&#39;s nevertheless work to do. I want it to be moist, dense,&nbsp;and unctuous. What I made was still too airy and too dry.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3912522"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/9be372dd-45f9-4929-87c8-c9302f58146a.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>The orange-cardamom-tomato shrimp dish has promise. I don&#39;t think I got the pan hot enough. It wasn&#39;t bad, so much as lacking in depth and intensity of flavor.<br/>
<br/>
For the week ahead, I need to do a bit of a repeat. I still have lots&nbsp;of (delicious) <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/14/how-to-make-the-perfect-salsa-verde"">salsa verde</a> left in the refrigerator. Rather unoriginally, I&#39;m going to get my hands on yet more fish that is not salmon, slide it under the grill, and cover in more salsa verde. It&#39;s simple, but always a good idea. In a nod to a more formal Italian meal, I&#39;m thinking of doing that with a starter of <a href=""https://www.thespruceeats.com/garlic-spaghetti-aglio-e-olio-recipe-101815"">spaghetti aglio e olio</a>.<br/>
<br/>
As a veggie option, I&#39;m going to give <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/oct/20/nigel-slater-recipe-mushrooms-chickpeas-tahini"">this take on stuffed mushrooms</a> a try. I&#39;m inclined to think that the recipe ostensibly for two people will actually only serve me. At least that&#39;s what I&#39;m planning to shop for. Worst case, I have leftovers to enjoy for lunch one afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I&#39;m going to return to the Middle Easte-by-way-of-India <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2017/feb/16/how-to-make-the-perfect-vegetable-biryani"">biryani</a>. I once again can&#39;t quite figure out whether it&#39;s seasonal because it comes from a part of the world that gets hotter and never quite gets as cold as New England or Western Europe. But, the spices are warming as the weather here finally beds down, and I love a one-pot meal from time to time.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m planning to do the <a href=""http://www.beaualalouche.com/archives/2020/04/20/38208142.html"">chocolate chip&nbsp;cookies</a> from the wonderful Mokonuts Bakery in Paris as a sweet.&nbsp;They don&#39;t quite have the cult-like following of somewhere like Levain Bakery, but frankly I think these are better as exotic-twist-on-a-classic cookies go.<br/>
<br/>
Thanksgiving is coming up for we Americans. It&#39;s going to be a bit strange this year. I&#39;m still not entirely sure what I&#39;ll wind up doing. Either way, I&#39;m already thinking about new takes on classics to try. The idea of a cardamom pumpkin tart popped into my head the other day. As it turns out, that&#39;s a less original thought than I would&#39;ve guessed.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, I&#39;d always love to hear from you, and would encourage you to share this with anyone who might be interested.<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week 36","Hello readers,<br/>
<br/>
From a culinary point of view, the last week has been a dud, with maybe one exception.<br/>
<br/>
Reading it, I didn&#39;t quite put together that the Nigel Slater &quot;stuffed mushroom&quot; dish was basically mushrooms stuffed with hummus. I like mushrooms. I like hummus. But it&#39;s not the most interesting meal. So unappealing was the dish that I used some of the mushrooms to make an impromptu mushroom pasta dish.&nbsp;Likewise, I found the veggie biryani somewhat underwhelming. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything fundamentally flawed about a veggie biryani, but this one did not bowl me over.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3923094"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/e73af17c-6cde-4d60-b5b8-afdef4f6651b.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>The one bright spot were the Mokonuts-style chocolate sesame cookies. I hadn&#39;t made them in ages, and they really do use a lot of sesame seeds. I had just enough. I&#39;m going to have to restock. It was interesting to think about how much I spent on the ingredients for the cookies. I think it&#39;s possible that between the fancy single-origin chocolate and the fancy butter, the batch cost over $15. It&#39;s still a lot cheaper than buying designer cookies $4 a go, but it&#39;s slightly crazy to realize that.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3923098"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/6dbfc71c-9290-4454-9ff2-6bc7222337c4.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>The week ahead is a bit of a strange one for this newsletter. I&#39;m still a little undecided on what I&#39;m going to do for Thanksgiving. I&#39;m definitely <a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/8b492b58-fe67-4a17-8f0d-ca02d1a9936f"">not traveling</a>, but I feel like I have to do something at least a little special to commemorate. For anyone reading who&#39;s less on the fence food-wise, I&#39;ll take this first section to make a few suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re thinking of making a pumpkin pie, I&#39;m going to float a radical idea: <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2017/11/bravetart-butternut-pumpkin-pie-recipe.html"">make it with actual squash</a>. Not that I have anything per se against the canned pumpkin pur&eacute;e &mdash; I buy it all the time, for Thanksgiving and otherwise &mdash; but it&#39;s equally crazy to suggest it&#39;s as good as something that hasn&#39;t been blasted with pressure and heat as part of the canning process.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve hosted Thanksgiving for 30 and for two. If you&#39;re afraid of doing a turkey, they&#39;re really not that hard. If you&#39;re not looking to feed 30 people, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any shame in doing a <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/01/perfect-roast-chicken-recipe.html"">roast chicken</a>. Either way, I think it&#39;s essential to do mashed potatoes with a gravy. For the gravy in particular, there are really no excuses not to make it from scratch if you&#39;re roasting a whole bird. There are lots of very elaborate ways to do a superlative one. I think even <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2013/11/basic-turkey-gravy-thanksgiving-recipe.html"">something basic</a> is pretty nice.<br/>
<br/>
One tradition I&#39;m not a fan of are stodgy overcooked vegetable dishes. Skip the green bean casserole or bizarre yam-marshmallow concoctions and opt for something with a whiff of Mediterranean something. I&#39;d go for, say,&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/nov/12/squash-pumpkin-recipes-yotam-ottolenghi-gnocchi-braised-mash-butternut-coquina-queen"">braised squash with harissa</a>. It will go just fine with the cranberry sauce.<br/>
<br/>
Putting aside the vexed pandemic holiday planning, I have less vexed ideas for the rest of the week. For starters, with a bit of time off, I&#39;m going to take another run at doing <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50-yxbahn5I"">croissants</a>. I still haven&#39;t quite mastered the technique, but I&#39;m definitely getting better.<br/>
<br/>
Keeping with the idle baking theme, I&#39;m going to do some <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=007466294097402385199:m2ealvuxh1i&q=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2013/aug/22/how-to-make-perfect-bean-burgers&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwj8tLOZ0JTtAhXhSjABHaL6DN4QFjAAegQIAhAC&usg=AOvVaw3nyo-S1evqxZ7Udjz-beub"">black bean burgers</a> with &mdash; crucially &mdash; some <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOkZCTuGvs0"">DIY burger buns</a>. I&#39;ll probably pair that with my favorite side: some oven-blasted slivers of sweet potato.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been ages and ages since I&#39;ve done some mussels. If I can get fresh mussels, I&#39;ll probably be extraordinary boring and do something like a <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/mar/18/how-to-cook-moules-mariniere-recipe-felicity-cloake"">moules marini&egrave;re</a>. Though I think I&#39;ll pair that with some crusty bread rather than more fries. If not, maybe a seafood risotto.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, assuming I don&#39;t wind up also doing chicken for Thanksgiving, I&#39;m going to try out this Ottolenghi recipe for <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/sep/14/yotam-ottolenghi-recipes-for-five-ingredient-feast-cheese-mustard-cauliflower-soy-butter-chicken-stir-fry-orzo-pasta-fennel"">black pepper chicken</a>. I&#39;ll probably serve that with rice and some pan-steamed tender stem broccoli.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your Thanksgiving, however strange it may be this year, and as ever please feel free to pass this along.<br/>
<br/>
Until next week,<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week 37","Hello readers,<br/>
<br/>
For those interested in my renovation project, the process is creeping along. For the newsletter&#39;s purposes, it looks as though the biggest determinant of the program is the cabinet delivery time. That&#39;s going to take around three to four months, meaning I doubt work would start until the middle of winter. So there almost certainly will be a few installments of this in the new year.<br/>
<br/>
For Thanksgiving I did a suitably scaled-down spread. There was a disastrous loaf of bread that was meant to be for stuffing. The roast chicken &mdash; there was no way I was going to do a whole turkey &mdash; actually turned out quite nicely. The biggest discovery was a run at another Ottolgenghi recipe, the harissa-tinted squash that I linked to last week. That was excellent: I&#39;ll definitely be making that again.<br/>
<br/>
The moules marini&egrave;re were a bit of a letdown. Fortunately, not due to my cooking. Rather, probably half the mussels the fishmonger gave me wound up being dead and therefore unsafe to eat. Not that I have too many complaints about making up the lost calories with more bread, but I do like mussels. Other than that, I&#39;ve been coasting on leftovers. The black bean burgers will have to wait a bit.<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3935034"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/68802f3a-5ede-44e8-a9fc-d630d8eba1bd.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>The croissants are an interesting story. I still haven&#39;t quite gotten them where I want them. But they keep getting better. In particular, this time I remembered to save (and freeze) my scraps from last time, so I had some &quot;PF&quot; (<i>p&acirc;te fermet&eacute;e</i>) to toss in this batch. This appears to have improved the quality of my lamination. I didn&#39;t feel any of the butter poking through the dough and getting my hands greasy until the final step. And there, I suspect the issue was one of the dough not being relaxed enough: the longer it takes to roll out, the more time the butter has to soften. The easiest way to tell I struggled: most of the croissants only had five (rather than seven) segments. By the end, it was so hard to roll out, I had to stop before it got thin and big enough.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3935042"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/570c9fcd-f4aa-4486-9be3-9bdf80dbc12e.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>The week to come will be mostly a return to normal. Though there are some leftovers that still need using up. There are probably more creative or outright better ways I could use up the leftover chicken. But I find something strangely comforting about doing fajitas. That may or may not be related to quite how easy those are to throw together. Sometimes I do need a break from cooking.<br/>
<br/>
Once again I&#39;m going to turn to the reliable Yotam Ottolenghi for something to push my boundaries. I&#39;m thinking of trying his <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/nov/28/yotam-ottolenghi-noodle-recipes-sambal-crab-biang-biang-pineapple-vermicelli"">recipe from this week for biangbiang noodles</a>. Though I may tone it down a bit: I&#39;m not sure I want to have my mouth numbed with chilis. That feels like it will go well with some seared broccoli.<br/>
<br/>
For a shellfish fix, I&#39;m going to turn back to the <a href=""https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/seafood-risotto-risotto-ai-fruitti-di-mare-51112620"">seafood risotto</a> concept from last week. I&#39;m not convinced mussel quality is a memoryless process, plus I&#39;d like some variety. As the weather cools down more and winter begins really digging its heels in, I&#39;m thinking of pairing that with some cavolo nero tossed with a bit of garlic and olive oil.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I&#39;m going to do <a href=""https://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/fish-recipes/sicilian-style-tuna-carpaccio/"">tuna carpaccio</a>. I&#39;m not entirely sure what I&#39;ll serve that with. It feels very summery, but I don&#39;t really want a tuna steak, and I really do have a lot of frozen tuna that I need to use. Quite possibly I&#39;ll have my stuffing reprieve, assuming I can successfully execute a loaf of bread again in the coming days.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll wrap all this up with some <a href=""https://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/chocolate-recipes/scottish-shortbread/"">shortbread</a>. It&#39;s completely incongruous with everything here, to be sure: it&#39;s neither Chinese nor Italian. But that&#39;s what I&#39;m in the mood for. If I&#39;m feeling motivated, I may try to give it a slightly more relevant twist. I feel like a dash of five spice or an anise-cardamom kick pushes it slightly more into the realm of Chinese cooking.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re enjoying this, I&#39;d love to hear from you. I&#39;d also encourage you to share this with friends who may enjoy it! Writing this is a strange new part of my pandemic routine, but I won&#39;t pretend that it&#39;s not at least a little motivating to have even this small audience.<br/>
<br/>
Until next week,<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Christmas 2020 Special","Hello readers,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to be taking a break from writing this newsletter for a few weeks. Exactly how long, I&#39;m honestly too lazy to look at a calendar to figure out. It should be back sometime in January, however. Keep your eyes open for the usual delivery on one Sunday afternoon or another.<br/>
<br/>
Before I sign off for the year, however, I thought I&#39;d do a&nbsp;&quot;holiday special&quot; in the grand tradition of cooking TV series. I&#39;ll drop in a few links to food ideas, but I figured it might also be a nice idea to toss in a few gift ideas for the food enthusiast in your life.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Cookbooks</strong><br/>
<br/>
<a href=""https://www.workman.com/products/ad-hoc-at-home""><em>Ad Hoc at Home</em></a>, Thomas Keller<br/>
I hesitate ever so slightly to recommend this. On the one hand, the recipes are great. This is a perfect &quot;ambitious beginner&quot; cookbook. Yes, the chicken and dumplings take forever to make. They are sublime.&nbsp;Nor can it&nbsp;be denied how big an impact Thomas Keller has had on food in the US. On the other, I feel like he&#39;s sold out a little bit in the last 10 years. Slapping your name on the catering service on a mass-market cruise line smacks of rent seeking.<br/>
<br/>
<a href=""https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/1116643/how-to-eat/9781784874865.html""><em>How to Eat</em></a>, Nigella Lawson<br/>
Her first and possibly still best cookbook. Though I don&#39;t know it really should even be called a &quot;cookbook.&quot; It&#39;s more a memoir with some recipes. Of course, that&#39;s not why you buy it: you buy it for the luscious&nbsp;prose.<br/>
<em><img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3947318"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/7ac2d846-b7fb-4b13-8160-587c447c1ef1.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/><a href=""https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/1119381/cook--eat--repeat/9781784743666.html"">Cook, Eat, Repeat</a></em>, Nigella Lawson<br/>
Her latest cookbook. It&#39;s much more like&nbsp;<em>How to Eat</em>&nbsp;than previous more cookbook-like cookbooks. It&#39;s a joy to read.<br/>
<br/>
<a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/River-Cafe-Cook-Book/dp/0091812550/""><i>The River Cafe Cookbook</i></a>, Ruth Rodgers and Rose Gray<br/>
This has become the cookbook I turn to more than any other. It&#39;s astonishing that this was published in 1995. Nothing about it is dated. Every recipe is a joy. If I had to pick one cookbook to use for the rest of my life, this might well be it.<br/>
<br/>
<a href=""http://alamaisonlelivre.com""><em>&Agrave; la maison</em></a>, Victoire Loup<br/>
Yes, this is written in French. If you happen to know someone who can decipher it, it&#39;s a blast. The 60 recipes come from home kitchens of everyone from chefs running restaurants with three Michelin stars to the best spots to pick up a cookie in Paris.<br/>
<br/>
<a href=""https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/209665/vietnamese-home-cooking-by-charles-phan/""><em>Vietnamese Home Cooking</em></a>, Charles Phan<br/>
Phan is responsible for one of my favorite restaurants, The Slanted Door. This book is a lot more accessible than the <em>Slanted Door</em> book: it&#39;s food to make at home.<br/>
<br/>
<a href=""https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/248624/the-elements-of-pizza-by-ken-forkish/""><em>The Elements of Pizza</em></a>, Ken Forkish<br/>
His pizza restaurant is a family favorite. While you&#39;re never going to be able to make a true Neapolitan-style pizza at home without a very fancy oven, this book will get you close, and shows off a whole variety of other pizza techniques.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Food Products</strong><br/>
<br/>
Really good dried pasta<br/>
Look for something like Afeltra or Monograno. It will cost more than the basic stuff at a supermarket, but as a treat to give someone as a gift, it&#39;s worth every penny. You&#39;ll be able to tell the difference.<br/>
<br/>
Single-origin chocolate<br/>
That is, chocolate made from cocoa beans from one place. Like a vintage wine. My favorite producer is Pump Street, out of the UK. There are a few good US producers too, such as Dandelion out of San Francisco.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3947314"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/147192d6-1d0e-458e-ae5a-71d2b3c9767a.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>Fun spice blends<br/>
I like <a href=""https://www.curiospice.com"">Curio Spice</a> (here in Boston) or <a href=""https://www.laboiteny.com"">La Bo&icirc;te</a> (out of New York). Their spice blends are not your usual generic paprika-heavy chicken rub: think seaweed salt or fennel-citrus fleur de sel.<br/>
<br/>
Small estate tea<br/>
I had to get in a plug here for my favorite tea shop: <a href=""https://www.postcardteas.com"">Postcard Teas</a>, in London. Everything they sell is great, and comes from tea estates that are smaller than 25 acres.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Eat and Drink</strong><br/>
<br/>
The Christmas and New Year celebrations themselves aren&#39;t times I do a ton of cooking. I chip in, but spend more time as the person responsible for filling in all the more prosaic meals in between. For that reason, I don&#39;t have a handy go-to set of Christmas dishes.<br/>
<br/>
But there are a few quasi-traditions that I find myself thinking of, mostly sweets. While members of my family still use a recipe from the 1960s and an extruding press with tree-shaped inserts, I&#39;m going to encourage you to make <a href=""http://lovethatbite.com/recipe/german-spritz-cookies-spritzgeback/"">spritzgeb&auml;ck biscuits</a> with a piping bag.&nbsp;For Christmas morning, I&#39;m often drafted in to make <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2017/12/bravetart-homemade-cinnamon-rolls-recipe.html"">cinnamon buns</a>.<br/>
<br/>
I also love a good <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/12/slow-and-easy-pannetone-recipe.html"">panettone</a>. These are increasingly easy to find &mdash; my local Whole Foods stacks them floor to ceiling &mdash; if you want to buy one, and I would very much understand if you do. But they&#39;re actually not all that hard to make.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3947310"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/c3072423-dbde-49b7-9235-86e34738d71c.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>On the Japanese side of my family, we (at least in non-pandemic years) take the New Year celebration very seriously food-wise. I won&#39;t link to a recipe, but <em>mochi</em> is a must-have. For as long as I can remember, we&#39;ve been making it from scratch using a futuristic imported machine. It&#39;s not quite the same when it&#39;s not fresh.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re more exciting than I am, you might be looking for something to toast in the new year. I&#39;m going to recommend you search out a champagne or cr&eacute;mant that&#39;s <a href=""https://www.decanter.com/learn/advice/whats-difference-brut-nature-zero-dosage-373922/"">&quot;brut nature&quot; or &quot;brut z&eacute;ro.&quot;</a> That is, a sparkling wine with no sugar added (no <em>dosage</em>) for the yeast to consume and generate the bubbles. These are bone dry and delicious.<br/>
<br/>
This year will not have a ton of holiday parties, of course. If you want to pretend, I love doing <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/dec/18/how-make-perfect-gougeres-cheese-puffs-felicity-cloake-recipe"">goug&egrave;res</a> (savory choux pastry buns with cheese) for an hors d&#39;&oelig;uvre. The same technique for making choux dough can also be used, in its sweet variation, to do another great party snack: little <a href=""https://www.meilleurduchef.com/en/recipe/french-chouquettes.html"">chouquettes</a> made with pearl sugar.<br/>
<br/>
I hope at least one or two people have found this useful. As usual, feel free to forward this to friends, and I&#39;d love your feedback.<br/>
<br/>
Until next year,<br/>

This will be the last official edition for 2020. It&#39;s a strange feeling that the year is almost over. A lot has happened, and yet it feels like I&#39;ve been cheated out of a year that could have been. Fear not, however: next week I&#39;ve got an extra-long Christmas special ready to go.<br/>
<br/>
The week that&#39;s been has been a mixed bag, due mostly to my own lack of energy. I couldn&#39;t rouse myself to go to the trouble of making biangbiang noodles from scratch in the end.<br/>
<br/>
My risotto of questionable seasonal congruency was its usual comforting self. It was greatly helped by a batch of chicken stock made with the remnants of my Thanksgiving mini-feast the week before. I&#39;ve probably already said it before: using really good stock makes a huge difference. I&#39;m sure there are better brands of broth in a box. I doubt whether even the best is as good as even the most clumsily prepared stock that&#39;s not made with assorted flavor enhancers and scant quantities of identifiable food.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3947306"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/071c7107-c731-42ce-8b4b-d7bf8826f4cc.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>I haven&#39;t had a chance to do the tuna carpaccio, so it won&#39;t make the photo deadline. This is due mostly to my perpetual lack of foresight. Every time I realized it was tuna day, I had forgotten to move the tuna from the freezer to the refrigerator the night before. Usually I can work around this oversight by effecting a more rapid thaw in changes of cold water. That won&#39;t work if I want to carpaccio-ify the fish and eat it raw.<br/>
<br/>
The shortbread will also miss the photo deadline. Once I finished the leftover Thanksgiving sweets, I realized I was making olive oil biscuits for another activity, and two sweets at the same time was too much. But it will happen. I can&#39;t explain why, but I am desperate for some shortbread.<br/>
<br/>
For the week ahead, I&#39;m going to turn my hand back to the <a href=""https://topwithcinnamon.com/blueberry-carrot-muffins/"">carrot blueberry muffins</a>. I remain convinced I can reverse engineer the reference product with a few more attempts. This is all the more urgent because <a href=""http://cloverfoodlab.com"">my usual source</a> has phased out the blueberry for an inferior &quot;seasonal&quot; pumpkin number.<br/>
<br/>
Around this time last year I was meandering around Paris, disrupted by a once-in-a-generation transit strike rather than a global pandemic. Something about that has put me in mind of a classic dish of some stripe. I&#39;m still rolling around ideas in my head. My inclination is to something like a simple pan-roasted chicken breast with <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcDk-JcAnOw"">a chicken&nbsp;<em>glace</em></a>. If I were in a serious French restaurant, they&#39;d probably serve that with a very fancy starter. A pumpkin velout&eacute; would be nice. I&#39;m not sure I can muster the energy to find and prepare an eating pumpkin.<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3947394"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/99237958-386f-4449-967f-dc581266282e.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/><img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""3947338"" height=""426"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/083fbabf-b37d-4801-bc6b-dd3e92a3d229.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>I&#39;m in the mood for a <a href=""https://ottolenghi.co.uk/recipes/mushroom-and-herb-polenta"">polenta-mushroom combination</a> for the week&#39;s veggie option. My local Whole Foods had some promising wild mushrooms in last week. That might go well with more braised kale of some description. The only snag is that I&#39;m out of polenta, and on my last visit the friendly neighborhood Eataly only had the questionable quick-cook variety that I find always clumps.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I need to continue working through my supplies of frozen fish. I&#39;ve used up all the salmon and I don&#39;t particularly want to repeat tuna, which leaves the striped bass left to use. This I&#39;m planning to keep simple. It&#39;s hard to do better than a nice <a href=""https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/whole-striped-bass-with-lemon-and-mint-350088"">blast of heat under the grill</a>, a squeeze of citrus, and a herby sauce of some description. I&#39;ll probably do that with some haricots verts tossed in a bit of good olive oil.<br/>
<br/>
As ever, I&#39;d love to hear from you if you&#39;re enjoying the newsletter. Please feel free to share it with others!<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week 39","Hello readers,<br/>
<br/>
A lot has happened since I last wrote. I travelled for the first time since March 2020, I had a coronavirus&nbsp;test for the first time, and armed insurrectionists tried to overthrow the government. But I&#39;m now back, and hopefully some order will soon be restored to the world.<br/>
<br/>
There is still no firm start date for my <a href=""https://www.justonecookbook.com/miso-marinated-hamachi-bowl/"">kitchen renovation</a>. My best guess is that the newsletter will continue through the rest of the winter, and work may begin near the end of March.<br/>
<br/>
The past week has been an especially strange one, even in my own little bubble. Living in Massachusetts, I was required to quarantine for two weeks, or until I was able to produce a negative coronavirus test. As it turns out, getting a test is much more difficult than it ought to be, so I&#39;ve been stuck in my apartment since I got back from Christmas on the West Coast.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been eating a lot of delivery by consequence. It&#39;s amazing to think there are people who sustain themselves this way. It&#39;s incredibly expensive! And I say that as someone who doesn&#39;t bat an eye at spending $30 for a pound of peak-season king salmon. I&#39;ve been fairly pragmatic: there&#39;s not a lot of interest to report there.<br/>
<br/>
Turning to the week to come, I&#39;ll begin the week with yet more delivery and whatever I&#39;m able to cobble together from the store cupboard. Assuming &mdash; I think it&#39;s a safe bet &mdash; my coronavirus test comes back negative reasonably soon, then I can begin getting back into the swing of things.<br/>
<br/>
For obvious reasons I wasn&#39;t able to sample any of the fun restaurants in Portland this Christmas. But the highly abbreviated New Year feast this year has inspired me to explore Japanese food more than I already have.<br/>
<br/>
Like the French food culture, the Japanese love to take ideas from other places and mess around with them. In that direction, I&#39;m going to try a dish from&nbsp;<em>chuka ryori</em>, or the Japanese subgenre of dishes stolen from the Chinese and adapted to local tastes. Specifically, I like the look of this <a href=""https://www.justonecookbook.com/mapo-tofu/"">Japanese-style mapo tofu</a>. I&#39;m also planning to do this as my veggie option for the week by substituting the ground pork for a mushroom duxelles.<br/>
<br/>
Moving to a different part of Asia, I&#39;m going to repeat an old favorite, the <a href=""https://www.vickypham.com/blog/spicy-lemon-grass-chicken-ga-chin-sa-ot"">Slanted Door lemongrass chicken</a>. The Asian grocery should have good fresh lemongrass, and something about being at least on the same side of the country as the Slanted Door gave me a hankering for their lemongrass chicken. To go with, I&#39;ll make more of the fire-kissed baby bok choi that I first made last year after reading about&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/04/dining/stir-fry-recipe-wok-hei.html""><em>wok&nbsp;</em><i>hei</i>&nbsp;at home in Kenji Lopez-Alt&#39;s&nbsp;<em>Times</em>&nbsp;column</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I still have some amazing <a href=""http://ranchogordo.com"">Rancho Gordo</a> black beans to use up. I was tempted to do another black bean soup. Instead, I&#39;m going to do something close: a <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/01/eat-for-eight-bucks-black-bean-and-sweet-potato-chili-recipe.html"">black bean and sweet potato chili</a>. It also gives me a chance to use up some of the chilis in adobo and dried peppers I&#39;ve had sitting around for ages. If I&#39;m feeling underworked, I may try to toss together some cornbread to go along with.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4004354"" height=""426"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/68ef34c9-8dd2-4cfa-81a4-5cd1668a852a.jpeg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>As sweets go, I need at least a few weeks with no cookies, biscuits, or chocolate. Though at least I did get some excellent, excellent <a href=""https://www.grasmeregingerbread.co.uk"">Grasmere gingerbread</a> over Christmas. The winter, however, means that most fresh fruit isn&#39;t really a great option. To that end, I&#39;ll probably wind up doing something simple with frozen peak-season fruit, like a blueberry crumble.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be back next week with more to say, and the photo series should return, too. Is there anything you&#39;re interested in exploring in the new year? I&#39;d love to hear from you! And as ever, while I now think of this as a very public way to do meal planning, I do continue at least in part because people read it. If there&#39;s anyone you know who you think would enjoy, feel free to forward.<br/>
<br/>
Until then,<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week 40","Hello readers,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still settling back into the groove of writing this every week. Mostly in terms of getting the quantities right so I wind up not eating leftovers for many days in a row. A long winded way, in other words, of saying that I didn&#39;t get around to making everything I&#39;d planned.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href=""https://www.vox.com/22220301/covid-spread-new-strain-variants-safe-grocery-store-n95-masks-vaccine"">rise of new coronavirus variants</a> is also making me rethink even my weekly in-person shopping trips. Part of me is definitely afraid that I won&#39;t have as much control over what I get. More than that, there&#39;s something about grocery delivery that feels too&nbsp;decadent. I read somewhere that, even before the pandemic, the share of households with domestic help is at its highest levels since the Gilded Age peak in the late 19th and early 20th century, probably in large part because of people like me. I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s something to be proud of.<br/>
<br/>
Returning to what I did get around to, the black bean-sweet potato chili was pretty good. Either the recipe or my execution of it needs some work, however. Possibly both. My biggest complaint was the inclusion of beer. It definitely peps up the recipe. The chili is better for its addition.&nbsp;Either I didn&#39;t cook it down enough or there was too much of it, though. The beer dominated rather than lending that bit of background complexity. Also not the most photogenic meal.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4015326"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/39a6ed6f-c2bc-4eb9-abcb-4797d1ba07ab.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>The lemongrass chicken was its usual successful self. Unlike many other products, fresh lemongrass is not cheaper at H-Mart than it is at Whole Foods. I would contend that the quality is a bit better.<br/>
<br/>
Contemplating the week to come, I still have to actually begin my dive into new Japanese dishes, beginning with last week&#39;s <a href=""https://www.justonecookbook.com/mapo-tofu/"">Japanese-style mapo tofu</a>. Let&#39;s just say I made too much chili and too much lemongrass chicken.<br/>
<br/>
In typical fashion, I&#39;m going to try out another recipe from Yotam Ottolenghi&#39;s <em>Guardian</em> column. This preparation of <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/jan/16/yotam-ottolenghi-recipes-for-tinned-tuna-chickpeas-and-apples-miso-chickpea-salad-kohlrabi-tonnato-fried-apple-dumplings"">miso peanut butter chickpea salad</a> looks excellent. I&#39;ve become increasingly bored with what most people think of as a &quot;salad&quot; &mdash; some kind of dainty lettuce with a few chopped vegetables tossed in and maybe a vinaigrette. These chunkier more adventurous ones are much better for my money. As it&#39;s freezing outside, I&#39;ll probably pair that with something hot, maybe a simple rice noodle stir fry-type concoction.<br/>
<br/>
Last, I&#39;m going to try out this somewhat more experimental way to use up more of my recently replenished stock of frozen salmon. I&#39;m hoping that the <a href=""https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/kombu-cured-salmon-with-fresh-yuzu-kosho"">kombu cure in this preparation</a> will add a little extra zing. I&#39;m not sure how &quot;traditional&quot; this is, but it also definitely has a Japanese cant.<br/>
<br/>
For a sweet, I&#39;m going to throw together some <a href=""https://www.nigella.com/recipes/seed-studded-anzac-biscuits"">Anzac biscuits</a>. On some level, I feel like these aren&#39;t seasonal only insofar as Anzac Day is in April. On another, they&#39;re so good I don&#39;t really feel like I need an excuse. This wasn&#39;t a particularly inspired choice. Despite my Christmas cookie hangover, I can&#39;t get excited about fruit desserts in the dead of winter. I found this by more or less flipping through a cookbook.<br/>
<br/>
As ever, I&#39;d love to hear from you and please feel free to share with friends!<br/>
<br/>
Until next week,<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week 41","Hej l&aelig;sere,<br/>
<br/>
From a&nbsp;completion perspective, this is my first&nbsp;successful week in the new year. From a food satisfaction perspective, it was more of a mixed bag.<br/>
<br/>
The Japanese-vegetarian mapo tofu was very middling. I slightly wonder if the Japanese variant I tried had some of the edges rounded off. The biggest problem was easily remedied by adding more shoyu. The recipe as written was a little under-seasoned. It&#39;s also not the most photogenic dish, or is at least well beyond my food styling skills.<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4024810"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/0a9a6511-7e09-45f4-b655-df2671017930.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/><img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4024814"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/8bd88919-f04c-4895-8c12-d42870f27db4.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>In the end, I wound up throwing together some drunken noodles to go along with the chickpea salad. The salad is excellent even if I&#39;d make some tweaks next time. I&#39;m unconvinced the chickpeas needed to be roasted. Or at least that <em>all</em>&nbsp;of the chickpeas needed to be roasted.&nbsp;The peanuts and raw vegetables give a nice crunch. Some creamy chickpeas would&#39;ve been nice to contrast. It was also a mistake to use the miso I had &mdash; a very full-bodied red variety &mdash; which made everything a shade too salty. Drunken noodles are difficult to really mangle. They&#39;re an excellent excuse for another hit of cilantro.<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4024818"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/868cbfa0-5383-4f6d-91d4-11cc559f3289.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>The kombu-cured salmon really didn&#39;t seem worth it to me. Frankly, it seemed like an inferior version of the miso-marinated variety that I picked up at the beginning to this strange project from the late Taku Sekine.<br/>
<br/>
For next week, I&#39;m going to have a run at <a href=""https://www.justonecookbook.com/miso-marinated-hamachi-bowl/"">this hamachi bowl</a> that I found while trying to find a recipe for the Japanese-inflected mapo tofu. I still have lots of frozen tuna in my freezer that needs using, and this looks tasty. I&#39;m eating far more rice than I would typically; perhaps that&#39;s the inevitable consequence of eating more Japanese food.<br/>
<br/>
The wind is howling outside, and the draft at my desk is stronger than usual. I&#39;m in the mood for something warm and warming. Something like this <a href=""https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/food/recipe112.shtml"">quick fish soup</a> should be relatively easy to toss together. If I&#39;m feeling especially energetic, that would sit nicely with some braised kale.<br/>
<br/>
For a veggie option &mdash; and at the risk of seeming exceedingly dull &mdash; I&#39;m going to do yet another soup. Maybe I can&#39;t quite shake the need to put protein at the center of the meal. Possibly this is a better-justified requirement that I eat more than grains and vegetables. Whatever the case, if I&#39;m doing a veggie main I always feel like I have to use something like chickpeas or mushrooms, which, for reasons that I can&#39;t quite put my finger on, I&#39;m slightly sick of as I think about the week ahead. Thus soup. Thus soup with beans.<br/>
<br/>
My initial thought was a borlotti-cavolo nero soup from a cookbook I was flipping through. Then I realized I don&#39;t have quite enough borlotti beans left, Rancho Gordo is still out of everything, and I&#39;ve yet to find someone local selling dried borlotti beans worth buying. Thus more <a href=""https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018592-best-black-bean-soup"">black bean soup</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The Nordic countries are good at winter, I feel like. For this week&#39;s sweet I&#39;m going to try doing some <a href=""https://www.alt.dk/mad/opskrift/pebernodder-a-la-lagkagehuset"">pebern&oslash;dder</a> from the people of Denmark. They&#39;re a little out of season: my understanding is that they&#39;re more typically eaten at Christmas. But I like the idea of something (relatively) light with a hit of spice and, if I understand the concept correctly, a bit of crunch.<br/>
<br/>
As ever, I&#39;d love to hear from you, and please feel free to share this with friends!<br/>

Until next week,<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week 42","Hello readers,<br/>
<br/>
For better or worse, I&#39;ve settled back into an &quot;I can&#39;t go anywhere&quot; routine. The kitchen project <a href=""https://jkibe.github.io/kitchen145/cabinets-part-iv"">continues to inch along</a> &mdash; it too is suffering pandemic slowdowns &mdash; and it looks like I&#39;ll have a functional kitchen for the whole winter. On the plus side, that might mean it will be&nbsp;a bit less onerous to get more interesting takeout during the project.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4035614"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/533db54c-c663-4c3f-b137-78702dfb3a49.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>Beginning with the biggest success, like their design and their language, the Danes are onto something beautiful in their simplicity in the pebern&oslash;dder. There&#39;s room to improve the uniformity of them at the shaping stage, but that&#39;s about all I can complain about. They&#39;re wonderful and very easy to do.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4035618"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/338f8971-3990-41ba-a2e4-d0be24f7634c.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>The rest was fairly unremarkable to my eyes. The marinated tuna was very adequate. It would&#39;ve been better if I&#39;d hunted down some yellowtail, but I really do need to use up my supply of frozen tuna.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4035622"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/8fd0cc18-6875-4725-9db7-fedb388b6b78.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>The black bean soup was as good as usual. Perhaps slightly improved with the exotic heirloom beans I used. Likewise, the fish soup was a nice balm for the incredibly cold weather we&#39;re having here this weekend. It&#39;s an Italian dish, but the addition of ginger really does pep it up.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m putting a brief pause on my Japanese project. Largely this is because I&#39;m lazier than people imagine. I have it in my head to make something with udon or soba as my next Japanese dish. My local Whole Foods &mdash; even before the regrettable Amazon takeover &mdash; has never had good Japanese noodles. The best option is somewhat inconvenient when you combine freezing temperatures with a desire not to use public transport or ride in a car with another person. I&#39;ll return&nbsp;to this theme once I can get my hands on some noodles without compromises.<br/>
<br/>
Back we go, then, to something more Western. I&#39;m in the mood for the <a href=""https://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/cod-tomato-ginger-sauce"">tomato-ginger cod</a> from <a href=""https://lazare-paris.fr"">Brasserie Lazare</a>. (A quick reminder the recipes I link to are not necessarily the recipe that I&#39;m cooking.) Yes, fine, it&#39;s in many ways quite similar to the fish soup that I made last week. I have a whole bunch of ginger left to use, and it&#39;s freezing outside. I&#39;d like to think this, at least in the spirit of the original, will be a bit more refined.<br/>
<br/>
For a veggie option, I&#39;m going to do a <a href=""https://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/mushroom-recipes/mushroom-stroganoff/"">mushroom stroganoff</a>&nbsp;in the same line of thinking. It&#39;s freezing, it&#39;s winter, it&#39;s bleak (in more ways than one), and a stroganoff is a winter classic. I&#39;m not sure I agree with the Jamie Oliver stroganoff-rice combination, but neither am I optimistic about finding good egg noodles. The stroganoff may have to go over basmati rather than something slippery.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I&#39;m going to have a stab at another Ottolenghi recipe in the same it&#39;s-freezing-I-want-something-warming theme: a <a href=""https://ottolenghi.co.uk/recipes/puy-lentil-and-aubergine-stew"">lentil and eggplant stew</a>. I&#39;m saving my Puy lentils for another time, at least until supplies become more available again, so I&#39;m going to find out if the possibly even fancier black caviar lentils I have kicking around will do the job.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a part of me that wants to make something incredibly gooey and rich, like Nigella Lawson&#39;s wonderful cheeky <a href=""https://www.nigella.com/recipes/emergency-brownies"">emergency brownies</a>. As I play the image of eating that through my mind&#39;s eye, I can&#39;t help anticipating that slightly ugly feeling of sugar rush. Instead, I&#39;m going to have another try at an <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2019/04/olive-oil-cake-recipe.html"">olive oil cake</a>. I&#39;m in the mood for a hit of citrus.<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week 43","Hej l&aelig;sere,<br/>
<br/>
This week I have truly internalized the lesson that even a mass of grey-brown looks photogenic enough to share with a sprinkle of green.<br/>
<br/>
My memory of the lemon ginger cod from Saint Lazare was fuzzier than I thought. Whether I did justice to their version of the dish, I no longer feel qualified to judge. Either way, I was pretty happy with what I threw together. The ginger really does add a certain something, and my improvised lemon-thyme compound butter was very nice indeed.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4047574"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/7e84e479-7f09-4aba-b5f9-7ae59c4269dd.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/><img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4047578"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/694f8c07-5871-4476-ba17-90f7b258fa30.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>The mushroom stroganoff I&#39;ve done before. As more of a gin person, I don&#39;t tend to keep lots of whiskey around. The stroganoff was the worse for it. That hit of oaky smokiness and the flamb&eacute; would have added some needed complexity, even if it was still otherwise pretty good.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4047582"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/b93c48bb-6d60-4610-960c-eaf671aaf4bc.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>I was reasonably happy with the lentil-eggplant stew. It could have been a bit more stew-like. In the sense that there wasn&#39;t that wonderful thick gravy I associate with something like a short rib braise.

I&#39;ve expressed my relatively newfound admiration for the British-style mash-on-stew format in previous editions. This isn&#39;t an especially challenging dish either for my palette or my technical abilities. Next week promises more very cold weather, however. This is the balm I want.<br/>
<br/>
More on the challenging and experimental end, a <a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/0a98d7a1-a4f5-474b-acd9-5219e639b48b"">pan-fried mackerel and citrus salad</a>. I&#39;ve also mentioned my increasing indifference for standard &quot;salads&quot; recently. This citrus number &mdash; meant to be more savory than sweet, it goes without saying &mdash; is another nod in that direction. I&#39;m less optimistic that mackerel will be possible to find. Something less characterful (but available) may have to substitute.<br/>
<br/>
For a veggie option, it&#39;s more lentils. As more of a countercyclical injection of vividness, I&#39;m going to try this <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/jan/25/20-best-curry-recipes-rukmini-iyer-lime-and-coconut-dal"">red lentil coconut curry</a>. I suppose citrus, here in the form of lime, is in season, so perhaps this is winter-appropriate after all.<br/>
<br/>
As a sweet, I&#39;m still working my way through the olive oil cake. If I feel the need for more, I&#39;m inclined to reach for the <a href=""https://www.alt.dk/mad/opskrift/pebernodder-a-la-lagkagehuset"">pebern&oslash;dder again</a>. They&#39;re that easy, that good, and have a name that&#39;s fun to say.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d still love to hear from you if you&#39;re enjoying this, and, of course, please feel free to share with friends.<br/>
<br/>
Until next week,<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week 44","Hello readers,<br/>
<br/>
The past week has been reasonably successful from a food perspective. Though I once again didn&#39;t quite get the quantities right. The fish pie will have to wait for the week to come. On the plus side, the weather is still cold enough that I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;ve missed my comfort food window.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4059626"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/5e1544e4-e4f0-4866-b92a-6e5a6dbae396.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>Unsurprisingly, I wasn&#39;t able to get my hands on any mackerel. The citrus salad, though, was very nice. It&#39;s definitely in the mold of non-boring-piles-of-lettuce salads. I&#39;ve really become a fan of blood oranges &mdash; normal oranges are too sweet! &mdash; and putting them in a savory salad is a great idea.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4059630"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/5f4e952b-45e5-406f-a91f-e8de3dc2bbcb.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>For the second time, I can&#39;t recommend pebern&oslash;dder enough. They&#39;re so easy and so good. It also gives me pleasure that the word for butter in Danish is&nbsp;<em>sm&oslash;r</em>&nbsp;(like smear), as if the only spread worth knowing about is butter.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4059622"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/4322e021-6ae2-4723-854e-d03a7ad9d365.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>When I pulled the recipe for the lentil dal, I liked the sound of the combination of flavors. I hadn&#39;t quite read it thoroughly enough, however. It also turns out to be incredibly simple to throw together. A sort of one-dish meal. You can taste the shortcuts to some degree, but I think it works. Certainly relative to the level of effort, it&#39;s a great return on the time invested.<br/>
<br/>
For the week ahead, I remain in the mood for things warm and rich.<br/>
<br/>
As mentioned at the beginning, I still need to do the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2011/jan/27/how-cook-perfect-fish-pie"">fish pie</a>. I&#39;m having to slightly tweak mine because apparently my local Whole Foods did not have hot smoked white fish, and hot smoked salmon is surprisingly expensive. The suggested 350 grams would&#39;ve run almost $20!<br/>
<br/>
I have a bunch of celery and some slightly sad carrots that need using up. To that end, my veggie dish of the week will be another Felicty Cloake recipe. Her <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/sep/30/how-to-make-the-perfect-pasta-ai-funghi-recipe-felicity-cloake"">pasta ai funghi</a> is excellent, mostly thanks to the masterstroke of adding some pulverized porcini mushrooms as a flavor supercharger.<br/>
<br/>
The pandemic and the weather continue to frustrate my effort to make more Japanese food. This weather would be perfect for ramen or udon. I&#39;m too cheap to have it delivered from a restaurant, by the time I walk it home it&#39;s cold, and I can&#39;t get good noodles at the local Whole Foods. (This one I&#39;m not blaming on Uncle Jeff; the local branches of Whole Foods have never had good Japanese noodles.)<br/>
<br/>
In its stead, I&#39;m going to do a&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.papillesetpupilles.fr/2019/02/poulet-a-la-moutarde.html/""><em>poulet &agrave; la moutarde</em></a>, which is a fancy way of saying chicken braised in a mustard and white wine. It&#39;s actually quite simple to throw together, and will help me use up the bottle of wine I need to open for the fish pie. If I can get my hands on good polenta to replenish my stock, I&#39;ll swap that in for potatoes for some variety.<br/>
<br/>
For something sweet, I&#39;m going to take another run at PLF and do <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50-yxbahn5I"">more croissants</a> next weekend. I have the time, it goes without saying, and a top-class French bakery has yet to replace one of the empty storefronts in my neighborhood.<br/>
<br/>
As ever, I&#39;d love to hear from you and please share with friends!<br/>
<br/>
Until next week,<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week 45","<div>Hello readers,<br/>
<br/>
We are edging perilously close to the one year mark on this project. Current trends suggest this will keep going well past the 52nd edition, but we shall see.<br/>
<br/>
This sad milestone is not helped by the continuing fallout of the pandemic in other ways. After over two months of going back and forth with the manufacturer, my <a href=""https://jkibe.github.io/kitchen145/"">kitchen cabinets are finally ordered</a> and paid for. The bad news: delivery times have slipped again to 14-18 weeks. At this point, it may also wind up taking a year from engaging my architects to final delivery on what is a pretty small project.<br/>
<br/>
Back to food, the fish pie wound up working pretty well. At some point I am going to have to find someone who can sell me smoked haddock. Hot smoked salmon is great, but it&#39;s kind of boring to have salmon-on-salmon in a fish pie.<br/>
<br/>
The Felicity Cloake mushroom pasta continues to be a favorite. Though this time I used a wider noodle than my first attempt. Next time&nbsp;I have to find (or make) tagliatelle. The fettuccine was better than whatever noodle I used last time, but it still felt undersized.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4069966"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/408e3298-fa42-4cf3-be05-d00dd0a27511.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>In the end, I decided to make bread (to go with&nbsp;the chicken) instead of the croissants. Perhaps the lesson there is that I should try to drum up more motivation. For some reason I have no problem going through the crazy steps to make PLF, but hand washing the bowl of my stand mixer is a bridge too far. The chicken was somewhat unremarkable. A good way to use up a bottle of wine, if nothing else.<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4071382"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/babb5256-edf8-4711-bb12-7a627693f831.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/><img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4071386"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/4bc365b3-4398-4689-8d91-30726011dfd2.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>Looking forward, I find myself craving the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/jan/16/yotam-ottolenghi-recipes-for-tinned-tuna-chickpeas-and-apples-miso-chickpea-salad-kohlrabi-tonnato-fried-apple-dumplings"">chickpea salad</a> that I tried out a few weeks ago. With one attempt behind me, I&#39;ll have a chance to give this the tweaks I think it needs, like not roasting all the marinated chickpeas in the oven for more textural contrast.&nbsp;I&#39;m thinking of pairing that with something like these <a href=""https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017976-cod-cakes"">cod cakes</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The weather looks to be getting a bit more tolerable in the next couple of weeks, so hopefully I can resume my forays into Japanese cooking soon.<br/>
<br/>
At the opposite&nbsp;end of that spectrum, my quest for variety has pushed me into really wanting a hamburger. It gives me another opportunity to use the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOkZCTuGvs0"">excellent burger bun recipe</a> from my favorite YouTube channel. I&#39;m also going to be a horrible snob and get some of those excellent Impossible Foods faux burgers, which, for a weeknight dinner, are convincing enough for me. That might work with leftover chickpea salad, or if not that then some quick shoestring fries.<br/>
<br/>
Technically that might be a veggie option, but it doesn&#39;t really feel in the spirit of it. For that, I&#39;ll go back to <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/apr/29/felicity-cloake-perfect-vegetarian-chilli-recipe"">the excellent veggie chili</a> that I made nearer the beginning of this project. I have a ton of lesser dried beans that I bought for that explicitly that have been sitting around unused.<br/>
<br/>
In lieu of a sweet, I&#39;m going to try this <a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/67b4ce60-49c0-4635-a4fe-6ff600623fee"">savory bread recipe</a> from the excellent people at Honey &amp; Co. I feel like it doesn&#39;t culturally go with anything, but that&#39;s nothing to stop it from working well in a madcap fusion sort of way.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d still love to hear from you if you&#39;re enjoying this, and I&#39;d love for you to share it, too.<br/>
<br/>
Until next week,<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week 46","Hello readers,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not entirely sure what happened, but I&#39;ve once again done some bad planning. In the sense that I still haven&#39;t made the chili or done the burger night because I&#39;ve had too much else to get through.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4081774"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/f71bf41a-4c99-4cb8-aea2-0f650b51bfce.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>But I did crank out some more home-size baguettes &mdash; very tasty for breakfasts &mdash; and got around to the cod cakes and the second iteration of the chickpea miso salad. The cod cakes lacked cohesion: they fell apart during cooking. This may be my strange Schr&ouml;dinger&#39;s cheapness coming through again. Rather than buy a box of (very inexpensive) saltine crackers, I used rather posher water crackers that I already had at home. Likewise, due to pandemic restrictions, good olives were only available in pre-portioned containers. I couldn&#39;t bring myself to spend $15 on many times more kalamata olives than I actually needed for the bread.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4081770"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/9b9892cb-a61a-4e63-8d82-713cfebf27ad.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/><span style=""caret-color: rgb(85, 85, 85); color: rgb(85, 85, 85); font-size: 16px; font-style: normal;"">I&#39;m tossing in a photo of a grilled leek from two weeks ago for non-directed</span><span style=""caret-color: rgb(85, 85, 85); color: rgb(85, 85, 85); font-size: 16px; font-style: normal;"">&nbsp;visual interest. It hasn&#39;t been a very photogenic week.</span><br/>
<br/>
Going into next week, I did bake off the burger buns, so they&#39;re at least ready to go. The <a href=""https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/blog/2018/03/26/introduction-to-tangzhong"">tangzhong&nbsp;technique</a> really does work well for making super soft buns at home.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll&nbsp;actually bother to get around to doing the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/apr/29/felicity-cloake-perfect-vegetarian-chilli-recipe"">excellent veggie chili</a> that I was supposed to do this past week. In the spirit of making this newsletter more interesting, I&#39;d really like to do some cornbread to go with.&nbsp;I&#39;m having a surprisingly hard time getting my hands on good polenta, however, so it may not happen. Either way, I will confess to having a preference for <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2015/11/southern-unsweetened-cornbread-recipe.html"">southern cornbread</a>, despite being a devoted northerner in most matters.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been a few weeks since I&#39;ve dug into my pandemic stock of frozen fish, so this week I&#39;ll repeat the classic grilled salmon with <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/14/how-to-make-the-perfect-salsa-verde"">salsa verde</a>. I feel like I owe people reading this at least one slightly novel item, so instead of whatever else, I&#39;ll serve that with a <a href=""https://ottolenghi.co.uk/recipes/farro-and-roasted-red-pepper-salad"">farro and roasted red pepper salad</a> that feels at least somewhat seasonally appropriate. We are inching closer to spring, but aren&#39;t quite there yet.<br/>
<br/>
For a sweet, I&#39;m going more weekend breakfast this week. For the longest time I&#39;ve done pancakes for breakfast on weekends. I don&#39;t know why or how that happened, but there we are. I&#39;ve recently started swapping out the cr&egrave;me fra&icirc;che for tahini, which has been a nice change. It has to be said that even once a week, pancakes can still become repetitive. This time, I&#39;m going to toss together some <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/09/sunday-brunch-cinnamon-roll-recipe.html"">cinnamon buns</a>. Or maybe swap out the cinnamon for <a href=""https://madensverden.dk/kardemommeboller-god-opskrift/"">cardamom</a> and continue my slightly inexplicable exploration of Danish food.<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week 47","Hello readers,<br/>
<br/>
While we&#39;re still about a month out from the 52nd edition &mdash; the official one year mark &mdash; this is the one year anniversary of my pandemic confinement. It&#39;s difficult to imagine that a year ago I had just returned from a vacation on another continent.<br/>
<br/>
Last week I put all my plans right. I did non-burger burger night and&nbsp;I did the chili. The burgers, while tasty, didn&#39;t make the photo cut. The chili was excellent, though either I misremembered the level of heat intensity or I got unlucky with the chipotle I used this time. It wasn&#39;t so spicy as to be inedible, but I would&#39;ve liked it a few shades softer.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4093670"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/9f23fa44-652e-46c8-b3ae-d1957967eb57.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>The cardamom buns were another minimalist Danish success. They&#39;re incredibly easy. I usually cut the quantity of sugar recipes suggest. In this case, it felt like an error. The buns were almost a little too dull. Maybe I need to embrace the true Danish path and slather them with even more butter. (I really love that in Danish, butter is&nbsp;<em>sm&oslash;r</em>, like &quot;smear,&quot; as if there is nothing else you&#39;d ever want to slather onto a slice of bread.)<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4093678"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/9aaa5cea-449b-4ab8-a9ac-6413c833e338.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/><img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4093674"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/49681a41-bb5f-43d9-bd5c-bde276f2bd9c.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>The Italian-inflected salmon with farro salad was great. I forgot to buy basil for the salsa verde and wound up buying too little parsley for a full batch. It was still pretty good, and it&#39;s admittedly hard to tell it was a one-note sauce herb-wise. Still, I&#39;m convinced I could taste the difference. The farro salad I got more spot-on, and would highly recommend. I&#39;ll admit I&#39;m not the world&#39;s greatest fan of feta, so skipped that. Not that roasting red peppers is really that hard, I did cheat a bit by using some excellent (leftover) roasted red peppers from a jar.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4093682"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/9c7fe103-9597-4c81-a1b3-dfde76c4c3c5.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/><br/>
Next week, I&#39;m going to continue swapping dessert-desserts with interesting breakfast options. If not novel, I&#39;m going to really, seriously do <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50-yxbahn5I"">croissants</a> next weekend. My big problem is always forgetting to make the initial dough on Friday night. I really don&#39;t have anything that exhausting to do, and yet on Friday night I struggle to find the energy to make the dough to encase the butter.<br/>
<br/>
If the forecast is to be believed, we&#39;ll get a brief respite from the winter weather this week. I&#39;m going to attempt to ease my way in with this <a href=""https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/pan-seared-salt-and-pepper-fish"">salt and pepper fish recipe</a> that I found while poking around online.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also going to be very cold the rest of the week, which means I feel less guilty about blasting my oven to do <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/09/hacker-free-neapolitan-pizza-for-a-home-kitchen-recipe.html"" style=""font-style: normal; font-size: 16px;"">pizza</a>. I&#39;m too lazy to look up when I last did this. It was at least a little while ago, so I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m really repeating myself. If I&#39;m feeling motivated, I may branch out from the traditional mozzarella-basil-tomato trio and do mushroom-<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2010/sep/02/how-to-make-perfect-pesto"">pesto</a>. Either way, I&#39;ll pair that with roasted carrots to take full advantage of the super hot oven.<br/>
<br/>
For my more overtly veggie option, I&#39;m going to do another Ottolenghi recipe: <a href=""https://ottolenghi.co.uk/recipes/roasted-sweet-potato-with-pecan-and-maple-method"">roasted sweet potatoes with maple and pecans</a>. It needs something to go with it. I&#39;m really tempted to go all-in and serve it with rice and pita. I should probably do something slightly more measured. Maybe I&#39;ll roast off some cauliflower.<br/>
<br/>
As ever, I&#39;d love to hear from you. Have you learned anything from this over the past year? Eventually I&#39;ll be allowed out again. I&#39;m trying to figure out how this will evolve now that it&#39;s become embedded in my weekly routine. And, of course, please forward this to your friends if you&#39;re enjoying it. I do this primarily for myself, but especially for the (admittedly minimal) effort I put into the photos, it&#39;s nice to know someone&#39;s seeing them.<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week 48","Hello readers,<br/>
<br/>
Another week, and I&#39;m behind again. Professional bakers like to save the trimmings from their pastry to kickstart a new batch of dough. It minimizes food waste and the fermentation happening in the dough adds extra flavor. As I don&#39;t make (say) croissants from scratch every day, I usually freeze these leftovers until the next batch. So, while I did remember to make the croissant dough on Saturday night, I did not remember to take the PF (p&acirc;te ferment&eacute;e) out of the freezer on Friday night to thaw.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to tempt fate and make the croissants all in a single day. But that day is today, so the jury is still out on the result.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4104166"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/1d063259-0ab1-47a8-8f8f-fe8f570cb656.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>The rest was good. The salt and pepper fish was nice. Next time I&#39;m going to use a firmer fish &mdash; monkfish would be excellent &mdash; and an uncoated pan I can get hotter. There wasn&#39;t as much browning as I wanted, and cod doesn&#39;t really hold its shape.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4104170"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/e2b78eb9-74e1-47cc-b924-c817b88a993b.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/><img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4104174"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/9a4533f7-4c2f-4d80-abd9-f7104d5e9bf6.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>One of my lunch places had a great mushroom sandwich on the menu, so I kept it rather boring and stuck to mozzarella and basil for the pizza. I do really get a kick out of purple carrots. They&#39;re the same price, too, so &nbsp;why not?<br/>
<br/>
The sweet potato main has yet to happen. At the very least, I know I have all the ingredients.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward, the weather has settled back into a less unsettling early spring pattern. It&#39;s a tenuous link to be sure, but I&#39;m responding to it with comfort food in the form of <a href=""https://www.rickbayless.com/a-roasted-tomatillo-enchiladas-recipe-to-know-by-heart/"">enchiladas</a>. I&#39;m hoping someday the drug cartel problem improves (or I become vastly more Mexican street smart, which is probably even less likely), and I could safely visit a bunch of random tiny villages to really understand how the enchilada fits into the food culture. Until then, I will remain concerned that I&#39;m doing a disservice to people.<br/>
<br/>
For the (overtly) veggie option, I&#39;m going to try out this recipe for <a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/9dd437b5-c92c-4b8d-a96d-a1605df15fd4"">aubergine (eggplant) shawarma</a> from the always excellent people at Honey &amp; Co in London. (The fact they&#39;re one of the two regular contributors to the FT&#39;s food section makes me really feel at home with that as my primary international newspaper. Highly recommend.) I may not be able to get world-class baguettes here, but the fine people of <a href=""https://www.cloverfoodlab.com"">Clover</a> do a mean pita bread to go with.<br/>
<br/>
My salsa verde from a bit ago is languishing in my refrigerator. It&#39;s a vicious cycle: I make it to use up leftover parsley and basil &mdash; you have to buy so much &mdash; then I have too much <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/14/how-to-make-the-perfect-salsa-verde"">salsa verde</a>. At least it keeps much longer. So it&#39;s back to my mini River Cafe for one: some kind of roasted fish, some kind of roasted vegetable, maybe a bit of farro salad as a starter.<br/>
<br/>
For a sweet, I&#39;m planning to solve two problems at the same time by doing <a href=""https://www.baked-theblog.com/sourdough-brownies/#mv-creation-178-jtr"">sourdough discard brownies</a>. Between the cardamom buns and the pizza, I haven&#39;t felt like there was a good justification for making more bread. Which has meant my sourdough starter discard has gone straight in the bin, to keep it healthy. This is more indulgent than my usual sweet. At least it&#39;s for a good cause.<br/>
<br/>
As ever, I&#39;d love to hear from you, and please share!<br/>
<br/>
Until next week,<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week 49","Hello readers,<br/>
<br/>
Another week, though still very little to report. The weather does appear to have turned enough that I may visit a restaurant soon for some outdoor dining. Sadly, a&nbsp;number of <a href=""https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/02/18/lifestyle/eastern-standard-will-not-reopen/"">favorite places</a> have crossed the point of no return. Though I&#39;m also hoping that there will be a bit of renewal with lower rents and simply more space for new ideas to grow.<br/>
<br/>
Returning to the last week, on the one hand, I did make the croissants. On the other hand, it was a bit of a disaster. When it finally came time to make the croissants, I realized I only had oat milk. Such is my dedication, I forged ahead regardless. I haven&#39;t taken any measurements, but it&#39;s as if oat milk is drier than real dairy. Beyond the point of no return I realized the dough was too wet and too tough. The croissants were correspondingly too dense.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4115042"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/26d289c1-7d00-40e8-9aca-697fbb81cae4.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>The enchiladas were good, if unremarkable. I remain concerned that I&#39;m more&nbsp;<em>Emily in Paris</em>&nbsp;than&nbsp;<em>Elegance of the Hedgehog</em>&nbsp;in my level of cultural sophistication here. Likewise, I don&#39;t know I have much to say about my latest adventure in roasted fish with salsa verde.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4115050"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/4e00a7cd-44d4-405e-b4f0-eebd2cbdd7eb.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/><img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4115046"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/d62fa268-c736-49c8-81de-71dc5ce2c41b.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>The eggplant shwarma was more interesting. The concept is great. Between the recipe itself and my execution, it needs some work. Everything was under seasoned, and my homespun ras el hanout was too warm and not savory enough. The flavor was more eggplant nothingness than the salty earthy tang of good shwarma. I&#39;m thinking the addition of miso somewhere wouldn&#39;t go amiss. The other problem is deeper. Especially crammed into high-quality pita, it reminded me too much of the lunches I pick up from the people at Clover two or three times a week. Dinner needs to be more sacred.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4115914"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/7cdf2fc6-020b-421a-bf72-f84261ca161d.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>The brownies were fine in an unremarkable way. It&#39;s difficult not to enjoy eating something that&#39;s mostly made of chocolate, sugar, and butter. I suppose I was disappointed that more of the acid tang from the levain didn&#39;t come through.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4115918"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/c24e94a4-699c-43a4-a220-3c1a3ffa1dbb.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>Moving along to next week, I feel as though spring has finally arrived.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll dive back in with a <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/2019/09/the-secret-to-stovetop-paella-go-small.html"">seafood paella</a>. I&#39;ve made peace with paella at home in the same way I&#39;ve made peace with pizza at home. I&#39;m never going to have a home oven that goes to 500 &deg;C in the same way it will never be practical for me to own a three-foot paella pan and dig a fire pit. But with a little scientific thinking &mdash; mainly, only do paella for one or two people at home &mdash; it&#39;s possible to get good results.<br/>
<br/>
As my overtly veggie option, I&#39;m going to have a stab at doing more bao, inspired by <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/2013/02/the-vegan-experience-two-steamed-bun-variations-to-knock-your-socks-off.html"">this series from Kenji Lopez-Alt</a> at Serious Eats. I&#39;m not sure I have the willpower to do any deep frying, but I ought to be able to take some inspiration from his ideas.<br/>
<br/>
While it&#39;s warmer, it&#39;s difficult to say it&#39;s actively warm. So I don&#39;t feel at all guilty taking the opportunity next weekend to try making <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLURsDaOr8hWXGHjXPa3nTFZnbqJcAfs4N"">ramen from scratch</a>. I&#39;ll probably go veggie here &mdash; I really love the earthiness-on-earthiness of miso with mushroom &mdash; and will definitely pair the noodles with an interesting salad-y dish on the side.<br/>
<br/>
Sweet-wise, I need something to contrast with the last week&#39;s incredibly indulgent brownies. It&#39;s very possible I may not even do something sweet this week. Though if I do, it will likely be something else I can tell myself is appropriate for breakfast, like this <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gc61v-1oyUg"">babka</a> on my favorite YouTube channel.<br/>
<br/>
Last but not least, Easter is just around the corner, which means it&#39;s my annual hot cross bun day (Good Friday for non-apostates) soon. I&#39;m stocking up early on essentials. By which I mean restocking my supply of dried currants.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d still love to hear from you if you&#39;re enjoying this nearly a year in. And, of course, please feel free to evangelize on my behalf.<br/>
<br/>
Until next week,<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week 52","<div>Hello readers,<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the official one-year anniversary of the newsletter. Though like other <a href=""https://epiforecasts.io/covid/posts/national/united-states/"">grim statistics</a> during this pandemic, I think technically the one year anniversary was a few weeks ago. Or maybe not. I took a few weeks off at Christmas, and I didn&#39;t start the newsletter until a few weeks after I had switched to the meal planning lifestyle.<br/>
<br/>
The longer term future of the newsletter&nbsp;remains a bit uncertain. The public health situation is improving, though I&#39;m not taking anything for granted. My misadventures in takeout during the <a href=""https://jkibe.github.io/kitchen145/"">kitchen project</a>&nbsp;might not be very interesting.&nbsp;One idea I have had that I may follow through on is to turn this into a cookbook. It won&#39;t be the first time I&#39;ve tried, but &quot;here&#39;s what I learned doing forced meal planning during a global pandemic&quot; might be the hook a literary agent will bite.<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, if you&#39;re one of the sage, high-quality individuals&nbsp;who do wait with bated breath for this email every week, there&#39;s at least another month to go before anything will change. My cabinets are still an idea in the production backlog somewhere in Denmark.<br/>
<br/>
Back to regularly scheduled programming.<br/>
<br/>
Somehow, I hadn&#39;t realized I was down to my last tablespoon of curry powder. A very convincing katsu curry sauce was not as punchy as it could&#39;ve been. For reasons beyond my understanding, I decided to do roast cauliflower with the rice,&nbsp;chicken, and curry sauce. Beige-on-beige-on-beige does not make for an especially appetizing photo.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4147206"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/091ffd3e-3614-42e2-aabb-28d50291485b.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>The gnocchi were pretty good. I&#39;m increasingly confident I can&nbsp;say I know how to make them with my head held high. The veggie rag&ugrave; was close, but not quite right. The biggest problem was the lentils. They shouldn&#39;t be&nbsp;there at all, Jamie Oliver. It felt almost heretical to waste precious Puy lentils.&nbsp;Otherwise, the sauce was amazingly convincing. Swapping the lentils out for some more roughly chopped mushrooms will do the trick next time.<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4147214"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/1054e9aa-f7ad-4fab-9b38-b460c7ea9bf5.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>When it came time to do the tofu, I realized that I forgot to buy tofu. Fortunately I made more gnocchi than I needed, so I&#39;ll rustle something up with those to bridge the gap. <a href=""https://ottolenghi.co.uk/recipes/black-pepper-tofu-a"">The tofu</a> will get an airing in the week to come. Or else.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4147218"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/ac526fdb-51cd-48ff-a52e-580d2c580e76.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>As the weather warms up and view outside gets greener, the menus need to reflect the change. It also occurred to me that I haven&#39;t done pasta in a couple of months. Even if I hadn&#39;t just done a rag&ugrave;, that sauce feels too heavy for spring. Instead, I&#39;m going to do <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2011/jun/09/how-to-cook-perfect-spaghetti-alle-vongole"">a shellfish pasta</a>. I have some really wonderful bronze-drawn Afeltra spaghetti that needs using. That will go with maybe a <a href=""https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/marinated-mixed-beans"">white bean salad</a>. There&#39;s something a bit sad about pasta as a whole meal by itself.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I&#39;m going to do an <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/CNMxsHPHCGG/"">ajo blanco</a> with fish and salad. I&#39;d really love to get my hands on a fatty fish other than salmon &mdash; sardines or mackerel come to mind &mdash; though I suspect that won&#39;t be possible. I&#39;d love to pair that with asparagus, assuming I can find good asparagus.<br/>
<br/>
For a sweet, there&#39;s really nothing more appropriate than this <a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/f0f6e28a-a740-41d4-b474-a003370e4613"">Coronaversary cake</a> from the people at Honey &amp; Co. Yes, it&#39;s indulgent. But we&#39;ve survived a year of this and I still really can&#39;t leave the house much. It&#39;s as good a time as any for a treat.<br/>
<br/>
As always, I&#39;d love to hear from you, and please feel free to share this with anyone you know!<br/>
<br/>
Until next week,<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week 50","Hello readers,<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been another week of getting less done than planned, for some good reasons and some less good reasons. On the plus side, the weather was just about warm enough to do some outdoor dining. One less dinner to do at home, in other words. The restaurant did a very made-for-Instagram tahini cheesecake. It was extremely tasty; I have mixed feelings about Instagram-worthiness driving menu decisions.&nbsp;On the negative side, I slightly overdid the paella and then realized that I needed a pasta machine for the ramen. So no ramen, and no photos of the bao, which aren&#39;t going to happen before my (admittedly self-imposed) filing deadline.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4125438"" height=""426"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/e8dd2d3f-866b-45b2-afb9-326b8fb43421.jpeg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>The paella was also slightly compromised by the unavailability of the shellfish that I like to use. I still haven&#39;t quite been able to get a good&nbsp;<em>socarrat</em>&nbsp;at home, though I feel like every time I inch closer. For a long time I thought it was the rice. Then I hunted down a bag of fancy heritage bomba rice from Spain, and realized it was my technique. I suspect I use slightly too much liquid or the &quot;high&quot; setting on my circa 1980s range isn&#39;t quite enough.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4125442"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/d48d4860-9113-4ac6-a6fe-3e10c7350dbe.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>Considering next week, I&#39;ll start with the sweet. It&#39;s Easter next weekend, meaning it&#39;s time for buns. For the last few years I&#39;ve pretended to be Episcopalian and made hot cross buns on Good Friday, as is the tradition. I planned on doing that this year as well until reading about Colomba di Pasqua, the Italian equivalent, in the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/mar/27/yotam-ottolenghi-easter-recipes-slow-cooked-lamb-figs-herbs-chocolate-hazelnut-buns"">latest Ottolenghi piece</a> in the&nbsp;<em>Guardian</em>. Chocolate is more Christmas than Easter in my mind, but variety is always good.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m hoping I can get some in-season asparagus now that spring is here. I don&#39;t know that I want to do anything radically complicated with it. Maybe I&#39;ll do a <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2017/04/asparagus-tarragon-veloute-soup-recipe.html"">velout&eacute;</a> if I&#39;m feeling fancy. Either way, I&#39;ll do that with <a href=""https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/salmon-with-lentils-and-mustard-herb-butter-em-saumon-aux-lentilles-em-241768"">salmon on Puy lentils</a>, one of my favorite combinations.<br/>
<br/>
For a veggie option, I&#39;m going to try my hand at <a href=""https://www.rickbayless.com/recipe/soft-taco-filling-stewed-mushrooms-with-onions-and-garlic/"">mushroom tacos</a>. Paired with some kind of roast vegetable. Here again, I feel like I don&#39;t know the cultural context well enough to know what would go with something like that.<br/>
<br/>
Mostly as an excuse to bake more bread, I&#39;m going to try this take on <a href=""https://ottolenghi.co.uk/recipes/braised-eggs-with-leek-and-za-atar"">baked eggs with za&#39;atar</a>. Despite obviously making very different food week to week, something is beginning to feel repetitive. Something about an egg main for dinner worked as a way to mix it up.<br/>
<br/>
Once again, I&#39;d love to hear from you if you&#39;re enjoying this, and please feel more than welcome to plug this to others!<br/>
<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week 51","Hello readers,<br/>
<br/>
Spring seems to be arriving in fits and starts. Where last weekend it was warm enough to eat outside, this weekend is decidedly more frosty. On the plus side, this has meant all my plans have gone more or less as expected. It feels about right for Easter.<br/>
<br/>
Last week&#39;s promised bao turned out to be a big success. I was particularly impressed with myself considering I&#39;d never done these more sandwich-style dumplings before. If I had to split hairs, cilantro would&#39;ve been a nice addition. Once my pre-renovation moratorium on new kitchen gadgets is lifted, I&#39;m going to finally invest in a set of bamboo steamers, which would&#39;ve made these easier to make.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4135254"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/581297cb-c22a-4474-9939-c8b4dba92292.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>The mushroom tacos left something to be desired. My cooking was too gentle for starters. I also thought the tomato was too aggressive. It was kind of like eating a pasta sauce in a tortilla. Or, perhaps not quite as bad as that, but definitely not the best Mexican food I&#39;ve ever had by a long way.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of Mexico, all the asparagus at my friendly neighborhood Whole Foods was from, yes, Mexico. It&#39;s not the same as the really fresh, in-season stuff, even if I feel like most of what we get in the Northeast comes from New Jersey. Not that I have anything against New Jersey per se either, except that it&#39;s not exactly a place I associate with a <em>terroir</em>. All of which is to say I bought spinach to go with the salmon and lentils instead.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4135262"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/ee45138d-c46a-49a8-96fe-5bc4622fea21.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/><img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4135258"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/271a916a-076c-4f67-a9b2-d407ab6d0818.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>Another surprising casualty: my Italian knockoff hot cross buns. I tried going to three different stores, and none of them had hazelnuts. My block of very fancy block of chocolate, purchased for the occasion, remains unused. But Good Friday needed to be celebrated. I&#39;ve never had a problem making hot cross buns that taste good. This year&#39;s batch was superb. Many years into the HXB tradition, though, and I still haven&#39;t learned the lesson that the piping needs to be very thin and delicate to counteract the heat of the oven. Still photogenic enough to feature (just); not my best work either.<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4136606"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/85388d2e-44e1-49fb-b925-d032f9af523d.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>The leek-egg combination lived up to expectations. It did go well with crusty bread and a glass of dry white wine.<br/>
<br/>
Moving along to the week ahead,&nbsp;I&#39;m going to get some <a href=""https://tasteofmaroc.com/how-to-make-preserved-lemons/"">preserved lemons</a> going. They are truly magical, and I&#39;ve never been able to find them at the grocery store in the US. Luckily, they&#39;re extremely easy &mdash; if slow &mdash; to make.<br/>
<br/>
The overtly veggie choice for the week will be a permutation of gnocchi with a <a href=""https://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/pasta-recipes/mushroom-lentil-pappardelle-bolognese/"">mushroom rag&ugrave;</a>. It&#39;s maddeningly difficult to find a recipe that isn&#39;t written by a questionable vegan health guru who seems more concerned about including walnuts for unspecified reasons than making a good sauce. It&#39;s a noble concept, however, so I&#39;d like to figure it out.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in an Anglo-Japanese comfort food mood. That or my travel withdrawal is so strong I&#39;m craving airport food. Which is to say I&#39;m going to try my hand at a <a href=""https://www.chowhound.com/recipes/japanese-chicken-katsu-curry-31535"">katsu curry</a>, Wagamama staple. In a sea of banality, it&#39;s the most exciting place to get lunch or dinner on a Heathrow layover. (Yes, I know I could go to an actual Wagamama here, today. Wagamama is not <em>that</em>&nbsp;exciting, though: I&#39;m seizing my opportunity to actually cook while I still can.)<br/>
<br/>
Last but not least, I&#39;m going to try another Ottolenghi recipe in the form of <a href=""https://ottolenghi.co.uk/recipes/black-pepper-tofu-a"">black pepper tofu</a>. I&#39;ll put the lessons from the salt and pepper fish attempt &mdash; use an uncoated pan and turn the heat up very high &mdash; to use this time. As with the Mexican food, I feel like I&#39;m on shaky cultural ground. The few places I found anything suggested the salt-pepper-shallow fry concept is Cantonese. Given the sources, I&#39;m still dubious. If you run a food blog and want to write about food history, citations would be helpful!<br/>
<br/>
My supply of hot cross buns is plentiful, so I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to do another sweet this week. If I do, I&#39;d be tempted to go back to my croissant project.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re enjoying the newsletter, I&#39;m always happy to hear from people. Likewise &mdash; and I know I say it every week &mdash; please feel free to evangelize on my behalf.<br/>
<br/>
Until next week,<br/>

Nigella Lawson&#39;s <a href=""https://www.powells.com/book/cook-eat-repeat-ingredients-recipes-stories-9780063079540"">latest cookbook</a>&nbsp;has a&nbsp;US publication date. Through the power of international shipping, I can vouch for it being great. <span style=""caret-color: rgb(85, 85, 85); color: rgb(85, 85, 85); font-size: 16px; font-style: normal;"">It&#39;s a shame they didn&#39;t use the UK cover for the US edition.&nbsp;</span>I&#39;d highly recommend the <a href=""https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/nigella-lawson-wants-to-talk-to-people"">interview she did</a> with Helen Rosner in the&nbsp;<em>New Yorker.</em><br/>
<br/>
While I&#39;m recommending, there&#39;s a new <a href=""https://www.thesundaymess.com/newsletter"">newsletter called Mess</a> that promises to be good. (Warning: Not in English!) It has (much)&nbsp;higher production values than this and features every Sunday a new recipe from someone interesting.<br/>
<br/>
From last week,&nbsp;I should probably be less surprised that deep fried tofu is delicious. Or that anything deep fried is delicious. Yet&nbsp;here we are. The hint of fire from the pepper and the chili was excellent. My only real complaint: for such a superficially simple dish, it took&nbsp;forever. At least in part, I suspect I wasn&#39;t aggressive enough with the heat under the oil. There&#39;s still a chance I&#39;ll be cooking with <a href=""https://www.mieleusa.com/e/induction-cooktop-km-6365-9775900-p"">more power</a>&nbsp;sometime this summer.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4155102"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/8a3fab15-6a41-47b1-9e76-918b9d2e2198.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>The pasta was more restrained. Predictable, perhaps. I don&#39;t know there&#39;s much to say other than it&#39;s a really excellent combination.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4155110"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/8904101b-c148-4fbf-b384-236e771da770.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>My dreams of something fishy but different were once again foiled by a combination of bad planning, laziness, and ingredient unavailability. My supposedly upmarket local grocery store (aka Whole Foods) still only has questionable asparagus from Mexico, and there were no sardines at the fish counter. Then I realized I didn&#39;t have any stale bread for the sauce. The result was a very monochrome striped bass with butter parsley sauce that wasn&#39;t very photogenic.<br/>
<br/>
I usually try to do my big bake &mdash; in this case the corona-versary cake &mdash; on Friday or Saturday night. Frying the tofu and cleaning up afterwards&nbsp;took me out of the mood. A report on the cake will have to wait until next week.<br/>
<br/>
The weather is bedding down into something spring-like, and I&#39;m in the mood for <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/2013/08/the-food-lab-how-to-make-jerk-chicken-at-home.html"">jerk chicken</a>. Maybe I&#39;m getting ahead of myself and that&#39;s more a summer than spring dish. If I&#39;m feeling extra heretical, I may turn that into taco fodder. Once again, I&#39;d really, really love to pair that with asparagus. Once again, I fear that plan will be foiled by lack of good produce.<br/>
<br/>
Returning to my stash of frozen salmon, I&#39;m going to try this cheeky Ottolenghi <a href=""https://ottolenghi.co.uk/recipes/grilled-salmon-with-pine-nut-salsa"">recipe for salmon with pine nut salsa</a>. The origin story is excellent, and makes me feel at least slightly better about conforming to a certain stereotype. At least the people chez Ottolenghi have some self-awareness.<br/>
<br/>
For a&nbsp;veggie option, I&#39;m in the mood for a curry. Perhaps something like this <a href=""https://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/vegetable-recipes/gnarly-cauliflower-curry/"">cauliflower</a> <a href=""https://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/vegetable-recipes/easy-homemade-curry-pastes/"">curry</a>. It always feels like a bit of a cheat to bind everything together with coconut milk, but it&#39;s undeniable that it works.<br/>
<br/>
Given my late start on the very indulgent <a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/f0f6e28a-a740-41d4-b474-a003370e4613"">corona-versary cake</a> from last week, I&#39;ll probably refrain from doing a sweet. Unless, of course, I spot some really good produce on my resupply trip and come up with something to do with it. Guessing, that seems unlikely.<br/>
<br/>
Every week I say it, and every week I mean it: I&#39;d love to hear from you if you&#39;re enjoying the newsletter, and please don&#39;t hesitate to forward or plug it to friends.<br/>
<br/>
Until next week,<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week 54","Hello readers,<br/>
<br/>
I feel as though the world is in limbo. Soon, I&#39;ll be protected against COVID-19. Yet I have to remind myself that as badly as we bungled &mdash; continue to bungle, really &mdash; the management of the pandemic, we&#39;re head and shoulders above the rest of the world in truly being able to open back up.<br/>
<br/>
Which is to say, I had the realization that while I&#39;ll feel safe going about the world, the rest of it is still so closed down, there&#39;s a lot less that&#39;s safe to go and see. But who knows: perhaps there&#39;s a travel edition of the newsletter in the cards if my passport becomes usable again.<br/>
<br/>
The corona-versary cake that didn&#39;t make the deadline last week was a success. Though if we&#39;re honest, it&#39;s basically a <a href=""https://www.arte.tv/fr/videos/102882-000-A/le-mets-le-gateau-au-chocolat/"">flourless chocolate cake</a> with tahini. I couldn&#39;t bring myself to buy almond butter for one cake &mdash; they said a swap was acceptable! Perhaps my tahini obsession is a sign I&#39;ve been too strongly influenced by Yotam Ottolenghi and his brigade. I&#39;m not sure what I did to make the top so much like the surface of the moon. When it tastes good and you&#39;re not changing people $30 for a slice, I don&#39;t know how much that matters.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4165290"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/362b2b6c-26c9-447b-8229-ca0d1427891e.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>The jerk chicken, while delicious, falls once again into that category of food that tastes great but looks a little rough in photos. I&#39;m always scared when I throw the habaneros (I can never find scotch bonnets) in the marinade, and every time I&#39;m pleasantly surprised it&#39;s more a <span style=""caret-color: rgb(85, 85, 85); color: rgb(85, 85, 85); font-size: 16px; font-style: normal;"">floral&nbsp;</span>background warmth than something to burn the roof of my mouth off.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4165282"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/5df5342e-c24e-44d9-ac6d-5ca75a0de6b1.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/><img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4165286"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/fd7ea195-56cd-4fdd-a272-5eedc8932ff2.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>The cauliflower curry is the kernel of something great. The flavors were fantastic. If nothing else, I&#39;m definitely adding rogan josh curry paste to my more permanent repertoire. Swapping the suggested boiled lemon for preserved lemon was a great idea. The sauce was a bit watery &mdash; probably because I added too much water &mdash; and it was a shame all the charred curry paste got dissolved into the sauce upon the suggested flip. The onions were a bit of a mystery, too: more charred and rubbery than sweet and melting.<br/>
<br/>
Next time I&#39;ll probably use less water, give the cauliflower more time to cook on the cooktop, and then use the grill only for finishing.<br/>
<br/>
The recipe made so much curry, in fact, that I still haven&#39;t had a chance to do the salmon in time for my self-imposed publishing deadline.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of next week, the foray into a veggie curry has me in a curry mood. My inclination is to something fairly straightforward like a <a href=""https://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/prawn-recipes/easy-prawn-curry/"">prawn green curry</a>. I still haven&#39;t found a truly exceptional Indian food blog that&#39;s my speed, so I slightly lack for inspiration.<br/>
<br/>
To go with&nbsp;I&#39;m going to try my hand at doing <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/2011/08/the-food-lab-how-to-sort-of-make-naan-at-home.html"">naan at home</a>. Like pizza, I doubt I can achieve reference quality. But I suspect my slab of baking steel will produce something serviceable to go with the curry. It&#39;s also a great opportunity for doing a warmly spiced shallot <em>saag</em>.<br/>
<br/>
Keeping with the increasingly spring-like weather, I&#39;m in the mood for tacos. What exactly, I&#39;m not sure. I&#39;d kind of like to be virtuous and <a href=""https://www.thecuriouschickpea.com/shredded-mushroom-carnitas/"">something with mushrooms</a>. In the moment, I may cave to my hedonism and get pork shoulder.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m keeping my proverbial powder dry in case I need a night off to recover from dose one of the COVID-19 vaccine. If you&#39;re looking for another idea, I&#39;ll toss out this recipe from Ruth Rodgers (of one of my favorite restaurants) for <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/roasted-sea-bass-with-potatoes-capers-and-olives-recipe-by-ruth-rogers-11596193228"">roasted whole sea bass with fingerling potatoes</a>. Extremely easy, extremely good.<br/>
<br/>
For a sweet, I&#39;m hoping inspiration strikes while I&#39;m shopping and I come up with something fruit-based. If that doesn&#39;t happen, I continue to enjoy playing with <a href=""https://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/chocolate-recipes/scottish-shortbread/"">shortbread</a>. What struck my fancy there, I don&#39;t know. But I&#39;m enjoying exploring the space and making it my own. I also caught wind of <a href=""https://bonedaddies.com/shack-fuyu/"">a restaurant in London</a> that does <em>kinako</em>&nbsp;pain perdu, but that will have to wait for a future edition.<br/>
<br/>
Last but not least, my usual appeal: I&#39;d love to hear from you, and feel free to do some promotion on my behalf.<br/>
<br/>
Until next week,<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week 55","Hello readers,<br/>
<br/>
It has been an up and down week. On the up, I&#39;m now very much a convert to mango chutney. At this stage, I&#39;m not entirely sure what to do with it beyond the cheat&#39;s shrimp curry recipe I tried out. But it provided a really nice zing in that context. The color reminded me of a laksa. I didn&#39;t have the time or really the energy to try the naan. That will have to wait for another time.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4176498"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/6563a985-df6b-420d-9622-b03e2e710300.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>My friendly neighborhood Whole Foods had local asparagus in stock from the pastoral idyll of New Jersey. Maybe not the best asparagus I&#39;ve ever had, but easily the best I&#39;ve had this year.<br/>
<br/>
On the down, while my reaction to the COVID-19 injection was not awful, it really took my left arm out of commission for the next couple of days. Suffice to say the cheap and cheerful Thai restaurant down the street got some solid business from me in the last week.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4176502"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/9cbf1b2d-f219-4445-80eb-0dd535c4eaa4.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>My experiment in low-carbon carnitas was a serious dud. There&#39;s nothing to recommend the concept as far as I&#39;m concerned. It looked the part, but was flavorless and not very filling, like most dishes that lead with vegan rather than flavor. Mushrooms are pretty lean to begin with, but I doubt even using lard would have compensated for their utter lack of interestingness. Not to mention it was unbelievably expensive. Part of the beauty of carnitas is taking a relatively cheap cut of pork and transforming it into something amazing. At something close to $20 a pound for king oyster mushrooms, I might as well have been making lobster tacos.<br/>
<br/>
Looking ahead to next week, I recently discovered that Kenji Lopez-Alt has a YouTube channel, which led me to another YouTube channel called <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC54SLBnD5k5U3Q6N__UjbAw"">Chinese Cooking Demystified</a>. Watching their discussion of fried rice made me want to experiment with that concept a bit. I&#39;ll probably start with their <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n10xBmqehik"">basic formula</a> and see what happens from there.<br/>
<br/>
My preserved lemons are finally ready to be used, and to me the quintessential preserved lemon food is a <a href=""http://www.mymoroccanfood.com/home/2015/4/14/chicken-preserved-lemon-and-olives-tagine"">tagine</a> with couscous. Like Mexican food, I think of dishes from the Maghreb as spring or summer food because that part of the world is pretty warm year-round. While probably heretical to someone from the region, I usually toss in carrots or another vegetable that works with a braise to make it into a one-pot situation.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, assuming they have it at the fish counter, I&#39;m in the mood for monkfish. I&#39;ll probably do it very simply by popping it in a <a href=""https://www.jamieoliver.com/features/how-to-cook-fish-in-a-foil-bag/"">foil pouch</a> and cooking it in the oven. Probably with some white wine, rosemary, and a copious amount of butter. This might be another opportunity to enjoy the short window for in-season asparagus if it&#39;s still there on my next trip.<br/>
<br/>
For a sweet, I&#39;m going to take advantage of the temperate weather to have yet another run at doing <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50-yxbahn5I"">croissants</a>. Between the ongoing travel ban to Europe, my impending kitchen project, and the arrival of warmer weather, my window for great croissants this side of September is closing. I feel like I get better with every attempt, but I still haven&#39;t quite gotten to a point I&#39;m happy with.<br/>
<br/>
As usual, I&#39;d love to hear from you and please feel free to forward to anyone you think might enjoy it!<br/>
<br/>
Until next week,<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week 56","Hello readers,<br/>
<br/>
My impending <a href=""https://jkibe.github.io/kitchen145/"">kitchen renovation</a> is, well, still impending. But I did spend another $300 this week to upgrade to &quot;white glove&quot; delivery for the cabinets. Apparently this is cheaper than having a prospective contractor do it. It&#39;s progress of a sort.<br/>
<br/>
Food-wise, my preserved lemons weren&#39;t quite as ready as I thought. Not that it detracted much from the would-be tagine, which is always a winner. Visually, I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that this is one dish where purple carrots don&#39;t work as well as their more common orange cousins. It seemed fine in the pot; the photos looked a bit gross.<br/>
<br/>
For once the fish counter did have what I wanted, so I got my hands on monkfish. That really is not very photogenic at all either &mdash; or at least it&#39;s not with my amateurish pouch making and opening skills &mdash; even if it&#39;s very tasty. The heady wash of cr&egrave;me fra&icirc;che, rosemary, and white wine is very nice with a bit of crusty bread.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4186402"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/63cf7a09-1d5e-71fc-fb37-518d4cb047bf.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>My attempt at fried rice made my kitchen project feel that much more imperative. My circa 1980 GE range isn&#39;t as bad as it might appear, but nor can it pump 7,700 W into a single pan. That&#39;s still nowhere close to what a restaurant-style wok burner can do, but it&#39;s a lot closer than whatever I have now gets. It would also have been a lot easier to toss in a wok. Appliance and cookware deficiencies aside, taking the advice of Chinese Cooking Demystified did produce pretty good fried rice. I still have work to do, but it&#39;s the best fried rice I&#39;ve ever made at home.<br/>
<br/>
The verdict on my latest croissant attempt will have to wait. As usual, despite my best intentions I couldn&#39;t get it done before my deadline.<br/>
<br/>
Moving into next week, watching Kenji Lopez-Alt&#39;s YouTube channel has put me in the mood for pizza. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m ready to have pizza every Friday, but it&#39;s usually a winner. As ever, my usual recipe is this <a href=""https://recipes.oregonlive.com/recipes/saturday-pizza-dough"">very basic one</a> from one of my favorite pizza places. Purely for visual interest, I&#39;m going to deviate from the norm and do a mushroom pizza rather than the usual margherita.<br/>
<br/>
As an aside, Kenji&#39;s <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/03/dining/no-knead-bread-recipes.html"">recent piece revisiting</a> the no-knead bread phenomenon is worth a read. The <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RUDa0FKplk"">video he did</a> explaining the updated technique was really interesting.<br/>
<br/>
The weather still isn&#39;t that redolent of a Spanish summer, but that&#39;s not going to stop me from doing another repeat favorite and toss together a <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/stovetop-paella-mixta-for-two-with-chicken-and-shrimp"">paella</a>. As with fried rice, I&#39;m unlikely to make the best paella ever at home. That&#39;s not to say it can&#39;t be good. I know I mentioned the trick, such as it is, not too long ago: keep the portions small.<br/>
<br/>
Mostly as an excuse for returning to my <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/the-food-lab-how-to-sort-of-make-naan-at-home"">naan experiment</a>, I&#39;ll round things out with a nice <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/feb/07/vegetarian-recipe-spiced-lentils-yogurt"">dal</a> over rice. I&#39;ll probably whip up some cauliflower to go along with that. Doubling up with naan and rice feels a bit too decadent. I feel like cauliflower still melds well with the dal.<br/>
<br/>
For a sweet, I&#39;ve discovered that Fran&ccedil;ois-R&eacute;gis Gaudry does YouTube videos as well. (He&#39;s the host of a food show called <em>On va d&eacute;guster&nbsp;</em>on France Inter, the approximate French equivalent of NPR or Radio 4.) In particular, the recipe for a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M67njzFksaw"">flan p&acirc;tissier</a> that he featured from pastry w&uuml;nderkind&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.christophemichalak.com"">Christophe Michalak</a> caught my eye. It&#39;s a bit of a cheat by using corn starch as a stabilizer, but it looks really tasty.<br/>
<br/>
As I say every week, it&#39;s always fun to hear from you, and please feel free to forward this to anyone else who might enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
Until next week,<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week 57","Hello readers,<br/>
<br/>
While my <a href=""https://jkibe.github.io/kitchen145/"">kitchen project</a> (and thus to some extent this newsletter) remain in timeline limbo, there is some progress. The cabinets have left the factory in Denmark. Such are the conditions around global cargo, however, that the delivery date could be anything between the beginning of June through the end of July.<br/>
<br/>
In actual food last week, the croissants were, sadly, not my best. Granted, it&#39;s difficult to fail so miserably making croissants that they&#39;re not worth eating. I&#39;ve concluded the big problem is speed. The butter and dough warm at different rates: the dough is mostly water (specific heat of 4 J/g&deg;K), whereas the butter is mostly fat (specific heat of 2 J/g&deg;K). Not working fast enough, the butter heats more quickly and bleeds through, causing problems. If I had to guess, it&#39;s more a question of relaxing the dough more effectively than my lack of upper-body strength.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4195934"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/a62aba92-db5e-a239-db30-19bfa3598a3c.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>My paella was a lot more successful. After watching a few more videos, I realized that I wasn&#39;t being aggressive enough with the heat. I finally got the nice dry, separate grains that are the hallmark of great paella. Though this made me realize maybe I should get a carbon steel pan: I couldn&#39;t scrape the socarrat off the bottom. But my pre-renovation new purchase moratorium stands. More to put in storage whenever the project kicks off.<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4189594"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/48e6d414-5fac-85b0-1831-0f24696e4884.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>The curry was very nice. It&#39;s hard to go wrong with ginger and cilantro. The naan were a bit more of a mixed bag. As usual, it comes down to something technical that I can&#39;t really change. My <a href=""https://bakingsteel.com"">baking steel</a> is great, but it&#39;s not enough to overcome the fact my oven can&#39;t get above 550 &deg;F. Tasty, yes. Not quite as nice as bread out of a real tandoor.<br/>

In this case, I ran out of milk and completely forgot to buy cream. No flan this week: flan next week.<br/>
<br/>
Spring has quickly transitioned into full-on summer. Spring and fall never feel like the last quite as long as they should. Maybe it&#39;s premature: I&#39;m moving into full-on summer food mode.<br/>
<br/>
Starting with the conspicuously veggie option, I&#39;m going to have a run at doing tacos with fried tofu. I couldn&#39;t find a recipe that got everything I wanted. Most people making tacos with tofu do not share the yen for decadence I crave. My current plan is to use the <a href=""https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/crispy-tofu"">cornflour technique</a> from the <a href=""https://ottolenghi.co.uk/recipes/black-pepper-tofu-a"">black pepper tofu</a> from a few weeks ago. More ambitiously, I&#39;m going to try making my own corn tortillas if I can find masa on my next shop.<br/>
<br/>
Next, it&#39;s back to another favorite: the always great <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2012/jun/21/how-cook-perfect-moules-marinieres"">moules marini&egrave;res</a>. I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s much more to say, other than that I&#39;ll eat them with a light salad and great bread.<br/>
<br/>
Last but not least, I&#39;m going to do <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/spanish-style-garlic-shrimp-gambas-al-ajillo-recipe""><em>gambas al ajillo</em></a>, a fairly straightforward garlic shrimp dish. It would probably be heretical in Spain, but I really like the idea of serving that with coarse polenta to soak up all that garlic oil. With all semblance of cultural coherence out the window, I really want to try this <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dF0EkGoadtE"">carrot salad</a>. (Can you tell I still have a ton of time to watch cooking videos on YouTube?)<br/>
<br/>
It still feels too early in the year to find good stone fruit. If I see some great strawberries I may pick some up and do a sweet with those. Otherwise, I&#39;ll remember to buy milk and cream, and return to the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M67njzFksaw"">flan p&acirc;tissier</a> that I had planned to make last week.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s always great to hear from you. After a number of people independently suggested it, I will be making banh mi at some point soon. And of course, it is nice to know there are people who read this while I&#39;m still mostly stuck at home. Please forward to anyone who might be interested!<br/>
<br/>
Until next week,<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week 58","Hello readers,<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow I&#39;m set to get my second dose of an amazing mRNA <span style=""caret-color: rgb(85, 85, 85); color: rgb(85, 85, 85); font-size: 16px; font-style: normal;"">COVID-19</span>&nbsp;vaccine. The future of this newsletter remains a bit uncertain, though I&#39;m beginning to do something about a few of my ideas.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, back to the week that&#39;s been.<br/>
<br/>
My attempt at making a cheap and cheerful&nbsp;<em>flan p&acirc;tissier</em>&nbsp;was a mixed bag. The flavor was really not bad. The texture needed work. For whatever reason I hadn&#39;t put together that this was not really an exceptional flan recipe: it&#39;s cr&egrave;me anglaise that&#39;s baked in the oven. And yet somehow I managed to overcook the mix, and the eggs curdled more than would&#39;ve been ideal.<br/>
<br/>
The Spanish-style shrimp were lusciously garlicky. Infusing the oil with the shrimp shells and garlic before adding even more slivers of garlic delivers an excellent one-two punch. However heretical, it was great with polenta.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4204406"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/1d3fd374-e78e-8aaf-1a8b-2073a3b854ac.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>My taco experiment was more uneven. Making scratch tortillas really is worth the time. They&#39;re so, so much better than anything I can find at the local Whole Foods. Not to mention, a huge four-pound bag of masa &mdash; enough to make many dozens of tortillas &mdash; costs less than one bag of the fancy premium tortillas from the refrigerator case.&nbsp;The tortilla technique could use refinement, though. They were a bit ragged and uneven despite weighing each one out.<br/>
<br/>
Yet again,&nbsp;I&#39;m probably more surprised than I should be that fried tofu is delicious. My ad hoc salsa was held back by mediocre tomatoes and my own injudicious addition of citrus.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4204410"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/ecf724fc-33de-63ac-4e67-5bec567c048f.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/><img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4204418"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/7b2f8e35-7153-5791-462f-2575708c858a.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/><img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4204414"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/52f711d1-aed6-d406-9b3c-78f7eb7489df.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>Bad planning struck again with the mussels; I&#39;ll carry those forward to the week ahead.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of, summer has well and truly arrived. I had to turn on the air conditioning for the first time this year earlier in the week.<br/>
<br/>
It was in last week&#39;s Guardian, so I assume it&#39;s in-season: for this week&#39;s veggie option I&#39;m going to try <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/may/22/yotam-ottolenghi-tofu-recipes-spicy-sambal-beer-battered-coconut-flan-coffee-caramel"">this recipe</a> for tofu in a sambal from the excellent Ottolenghi column. I&#39;ll stir fry some baby bok choy to go along with that.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/mar/18/how-to-cook-moules-mariniere-recipe-felicity-cloake"">moules marini&egrave;res</a> have to make their return. I&#39;ll either make some bread or do the unthinkable and buy frozen fries. Even last week&#39;s shallow frying, while delicious, was too much cleanup. With that I&#39;m in the mood for maybe a <a href=""https://www.coupdepouce.com/cuisine/entrees-et-accompagnements/recette/salade-de-concombre-au-se-same"">cucumber salad</a>. It&#39;s not very culturally coherent I&#39;ll admit, but I find more prototypical salads boring.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, it&#39;s back to my never-ending supply of frozen fish. Restaurants in France were allowed to begin re-opening last week, so there&#39;s been an explosion of ideas from the people and places I follow. One had the idea of doing <a href=""https://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/salmon-recipes/crispy-korma-salmon/"">salmon with a sort of Indian twist</a> using tandoor spices. I&#39;m going to give it a try and see what happens.<br/>
<br/>
For a sweet we once again begin the vexed question of when to have my annual run at replicating the best peach tart I&#39;ve ever eaten. My hunch is that it&#39;s still too early in the year, and I need to wait for high summer. Still, with the weather as it is, I&#39;m inclined to a more summery sweet. Perhaps a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyivW8F8z7M"">clafoutis</a>. I have a difficult time going to the trouble of making a full-on tart when the fruit isn&#39;t excellent.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s always great to hear from you and as always a plug to share this with anyone else who might enjoy. My new cabinets could arrive as early as this week, though there&#39;s still no firm plan for the work to begin. In other words, there will be a next week.<br/>
<br/>
Until then,<br/>
Joseph","2021-05-23 03:53:24"
"Confinement Cooking, Week 59","Hello readers,<br/>
<br/>
Back in the spring of 2020, one of the talking heads I listen to said that it would be harder to unlock than to shut everything down. Here in the closest polity the US has to Finland, most remaining restrictions were lifted this weekend. Something has changed, and yet it&#39;s still not quite right. Despite the carnage, there are many changes I&#39;m going to embrace wholeheartedly. Once you start ordering lunch ahead for pickup, you&#39;ll never go back to endlessly waiting around. In other ways, I&#39;m having to confront other shifts as I reorient.<br/>
<br/>
Which is a roundabout way of saying that the time is steadily approaching to wind down this newsletter. It&#39;s been fun, and it will keep going for a few more weeks as I try to figure out what life in a post-vaccine world looks like. Or at the outside whenever my kitchen renovation finally gets going.<br/>
<br/>
Do not despair, however: I have another project in the works to fill the void for the small group of you who are still following along with this project. Watch this space.<br/>
<br/>
The last week really brings home the strange place I&#39;m in. To start, while I clearly was aware that I&#39;d get my second dose of the vaccine last week, I completely failed to register that having the second dose would take me out of commission for a couple of days. Still no mussels, then.<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, as other people I know are getting vaccinated as well, I&#39;m having to readjust to occasionally not cooking at home, as was the case this last week. No salmon, then.<br/>
<br/>
The absence of a clafoutis is something I can try to blame on Whole Foods, and by extension my moral nemesis Jeff Bezos: they didn&#39;t have any produce that looked worth the bother.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4214330"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/df619195-e55c-583f-f888-62f0003314f2.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/><img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4214326"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/47cd8395-0e08-9c6a-098c-5fb1298fb45c.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>Fortunately for this newsletter, I did have time to make the tofu sambal, which I&#39;d recommend. If I were to do it again, I might pare back the quantity of maple syrup and find an alternative to deep frying the tofu.<br/>
<br/>
Looking ahead to next week, I really, truly, will make the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/mar/18/how-to-cook-moules-mariniere-recipe-felicity-cloake"">mussels</a>. My continued misses haven&#39;t been for want of trying. Unlike a lot of other dishes &mdash; where you certainly don&#39;t have concerns if, say, tofu sits in the refrigerator for a few extra days &mdash; mussels demand to be cooked close to their purchase date. But the weather looks warm and my schedule looks free, so I ought to be able to make it happen.<br/>
<br/>
My giant bag of masa isn&#39;t going anywhere, either. I love the idea of doing a carnitas; I don&#39;t love the idea of braising pork shoulder for hours and hours when it&#39;s really hot and humid outside. Instead, I&#39;ll do a bit of a cheat and do <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/easy-mexican-chorizo-taco"">tacos with chorizo</a>. I thought about trying tamales, too, which really do demand masa. Maybe another time.<br/>
<br/>
As a veggie option for the week, I&#39;m going to return my hand to the <a href=""https://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/pasta-recipes/mushroom-lentil-pappardelle-bolognese/"">veggie rag&ugrave;</a> concept. It&#39;s really the antithesis of what I should be doing at this time of year. On the other hand, a more seasonal pasta dish almost inevitably involves tomatoes (still not quite in season here) or seafood (not veggie).<br/>
<br/>
For a sweet, I&#39;m thinking of splitting the difference and doing some kind of <a href=""https://www.nigella.com/recipes/lemon-pavlova"">pavlova</a>. Nothing too over-the-top or fancy. Reduced to its core, a pavlova is nothing more than a bit of meringue, whipped cream, and fruit. Now that the door is theoretically open to me having people round, whether or not the social pandemic of flakiness ever makes that happen, the idea of doing elaborate sweets for one feels somehow different.<br/>
<br/>
As ever, it&#39;s great to hear from the occasional person who drops me a line. Stay tuned for what comes next!<br/>
<br/>
Until next week,<br/>
Joseph","2021-05-26 23:09:06"
"Confinement Cooking, Week 60","Hello readers,<br/>
<br/>
Today is the last day that I&#39;m not fully vaccinated according to the CDC. Though it&#39;s taking a bit longer for the world around me to completely roar back to life. The newsletter is reaching its end, but we&#39;re not quite there yet.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re worried, I can share the follow on to this. I&#39;ve very creatively called the <a href=""https://therecipelog.com"">new project</a> a recipe log (should that be Recipe Log?), which, amazingly enough was an available domain name. Once this newsletter comes to an end, I&#39;ll share details on how to subscribe to an email drip. It&#39;s more or less moving my handwritten paper notes into the 21st century.<br/>
<br/>
Looking back on the week that&#39;s been, I did indeed make the mussels. I did not succeed in taking a photo that was in focus. They&#39;re great. I don&#39;t know what more there is to say.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4223602"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/c025a5a6-8efb-ddcd-8029-737fe978b4e9.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>The chorizo tacos were surprisingly good. Though on another level this reminds me of the fried tofu. I probably shouldn&#39;t be surprised that a taco filling made with fatty, salty Mexican chorizo would be pretty tasty. I am quickly realizing that if I even semi-regularly make my own corn tortillas, I should probably buy a piece of equipment to make forming the tortillas speedier. This should&#39;ve been a simple dinner; making almost-scratch tortillas does vastly complicate the job.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4223598"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/2ccc814d-6c1f-80ff-42d2-f0d9a96ad0c8.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>My second run at an eco-conscious rag&ugrave; was better, but still not quite where I&#39;d like it to be. It reminded me of the mushroom carnitas knockoff: not rich enough, a little flat. There was a part of me that wanted to add some lardons or pancetta, which would obviously defeat the purpose.<br/>
<br/>
Moving into next week, I&#39;m going to make more tacos, my lack of specialized equipment notwithstanding. First, however, a point of frustration. I grew up eating what I now think of as &quot;tacos.&quot; That is: fluorescent orange cheddar cheese, ground beef seasoned with a packet of seasoning, taco shells out of a box. Later, I discovered a higher grade of taco, and it&#39;s that taco I&#39;m exploring.<br/>
<br/>
Doing a search for, say, &quot;taco recipes&quot; on Google is deeply frustrating. One of the hits on the first page of results: &quot;Just Like Taco Bell Tacos.&quot; I hasten to add that in Mexico Taco Bell is marketed as American food. Not a single hit from a source that looked even vaguely Mexican.<br/>
<br/>
My frustration aside, I eventually remembered that Rick Bayless has a website, and found this interesting idea for <a href=""https://www.rickbayless.com/recipe/roasted-cauliflower-tacos-with-poblano-chile-and-caramelized-onion/"">roasted cauliflower tacos</a>. A veggie option, and a high-quality taco concept. There&#39;s even a video walkthrough.<br/>
<br/>
One realization that I&#39;ve had over the last 15 months: much as I love shopping for food, Whole Foods is not as seasonal a market as they claim. There isn&#39;t really much of a point in going more than once a week, even when that&#39;s allowed by public health advice. Hence: I still have a giant supply of frozen fish. For my easy out of the week, I&#39;m going to do the excellent <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/B_edxtSpg3q/"">miso salmon</a> that I discovered early in the first lockdown.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, if I wind up needing a third option, I feel like I&#39;m in a groove with my <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/the-secret-to-stovetop-paella-go-small"">paella</a> technique. I also have a ton of frozen scallops I need to use.<br/>
<br/>
None of this quite corresponds with the weather we&#39;re having. But I&#39;ve resigned myself to the fact that, without a large outdoor patio to have one of those wonderfully relaxed very late dinners in the dying summer heat, even modest air conditioning doesn&#39;t really gel with gazpacho.<br/>
<br/>
For a sweet, I&#39;ve more or less given up on there being great local fruit dessert fodder this early in the season. But I almost don&#39;t care. I&#39;m going to do a <a href=""https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/peach-galette-51185810"">peach galette</a>, even if the peaches have come from California.<br/>
<br/>
There are still a few more weeks of this to go, so stay tuned!<br/>
<br/>
Until next week,<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week 61","Hello readers,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve set a date: the last edition of the 2020-21 coronavirus pandemic newsletter will go out on the 27th of June. It&#39;s been fun, helped keep me grounded during a complicated year, and been useful for forcing me to try new ideas. I&#39;ll have more to say in the final edition.<br/>
<br/>
By next week I&#39;m hoping to have the newsletter drip of recipes from my <a href=""https://therecipelog.com"">quasi-blog</a> ready for sign ups as well.<br/>
<br/>
The last week especially has confirmed my feeling it&#39;s time to draw this to a close. Almost overnight my world has switched from being stuck at home to people once again being so flaky it&#39;s difficult to schedule anything.<br/>
<br/>
Through the vagaries of time management, several would-be dinners tuned out to be not-dinners, which left me slightly caught out. I made the tacos, and the paella, and the fish, and then realized all I didn&#39;t have enough food to make a complete meal by yesterday.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4232114"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/4d6cae8a-12eb-d2f0-62b7-515901e6aea5.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/><img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4232118"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/aca66fdc-4b4d-5283-6c87-56ac9df5a7dc.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>Even so, the cauliflower tacos were definitely a success. I don&#39;t know whether it was the tortillas or the cr&egrave;me fra&icirc;che, but these were satisfying and interesting veggie tacos that I would make again.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also now very confident in my paella making skills. The trick really is going small. My widest pan isn&#39;t big enough to do paella for more than about one hungry person. I don&#39;t totally understand why a shallower distribution of rice makes such a big difference yet. Fortunately, now that I have the process down, I can see how it would be possible to make paella <i>&agrave; la minute</i>&nbsp;in a restaurant.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4232442"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/cb8666fd-f7ed-758e-f7e8-9fda12e52301.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>The miso salmon is the miso salmon. It&#39;s a great combination and that&#39;s all there is to say about it.<br/>
<br/>
Looking to the week ahead, I&#39;m going to reaffirm my belief in planning for the worst and hoping for the best. By which I mean I&#39;m going to plan for seven full meals, and carry a few over rather than being shorthanded. Getting cheap and cheerful takeout should be a choice, not a necessity.<br/>
<br/>
My bag of masa remains pretty full, so I&#39;m going to continue my exploration of the taco concept. I&#39;ve given up on trying to find a good source of taco recipes, though. I&#39;ll keep this my veggie option for the week with something like a <a href=""https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015176-black-bean-and-poblano-tacos"">black bean-poblano</a> filling. If you&#39;re looking for a good salsa recipe, Kenji Lopez-Alt&#39;s YouTube channel has a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BQ9cqe32Zg"">video walkthrough</a> of something very close to my method.<br/>
<br/>
Next: I&#39;m going to keep my promise and do some banh mi. I&#39;m tempted to try this <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/how-to-make-vegan-vietnamese-grilled-tofu-lemongrass-coriander-sandwich-banh-mi"">lemongrass-tofu variation</a>. Not because I&#39;m per se opposed to, say, pork belly, but rather because I don&#39;t want to have to deal with the mess of, say, shallow frying breaded pork belly.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I&#39;m in the mood for <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/the-food-lab-how-to-make-jerk-chicken-at-home"">jerk chicken</a>. If i&#39;m feeling ambitious, I may try to hunt down some scotch bonnet chilis to see what impact that has. The marinade and grill does a lot to moderate the intensity of the chilis &mdash; plus the recipe doesn&#39;t use many &mdash; but I find having that lick of heat and fruitiness makes a big difference.<br/>
<br/>
Now it&#39;s well and truly summer, I have a difficult time doing big, rich desserts. Taking inspiration from the banh mi, I&#39;ve plucked out a recipe for tapioca and coconut sorbet from <a href=""https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/209667/the-slanted-door-by-charles-phan/""><em>The Slanted Door</em></a>. Apparently this is more of a Taiwanese dessert in the vein of bubble tea. I&#39;m not a huge fan of bubble tea, but I do like tapioca more generally, so this feels worth trying.<br/>
<br/>
As ever, it&#39;s always great to hear from you. Stayed tuned for what comes next.<br/>
<br/>
Until next week,<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, Week 62","Hello readers,<br/>
<br/>
As promised, you can now sign up for my <a href=""https://mailchi.mp/df15b737a1e9/josephs-recipe-log"">new newsletter</a>. Forgive the lackluster production values: I&#39;m not trying to turn this into a business or become a so-called influencer. I&#39;m hoping instead to send a message approximately once a month with highlights, observations, and tidbits. I&#39;ll also continue adding and updating recipes from my paper notebooks in my <a href=""https://github.com/jkibe/recipes"">Git repository</a>&nbsp;and that&#39;s published in a <a href=""https://therecipelog.com"">more readable format</a>. I&#39;ll mention this next week as well &mdash; the last edition of this particular experiment.<br/>
<br/>
I did get up to a fair bit of cooking this past week. In fact, I got through everything, with the usual dose of planning-related errors and unavailability of ingredients that I&#39;ll continue to blame on Jeff Bezos.<br/>
<br/>
Starting with the sweet, I wound up having to eat coconut sorbet without the tapioca. My local Whole Foods had tapioca powder but no tapioca pearls. A blob of amorphous tapioca goo was not appealing. But I did get my hands on some pretty good coconut sorbet, so it wasn&#39;t a complete disaster.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4241042"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/043c626f-5ef9-1dd6-b952-62e0d88940fc.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/><img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4241258"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/7249e0cd-da0f-55b8-57a8-a40b57e21594.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>The banh mi were a bit more mixed. My sourdough starter, going strong since before the pandemic set in, got infected by something orange and spotty. It was pretty gross and a little sad to have to reboot my starter. It also meant my baguettes for the banh mi weren&#39;t quite as good as they could&#39;ve been. Bread&nbsp;<em>sur levain</em>&nbsp;really is a lot tastier.&nbsp;But it was, overall, a pretty nice experiment on a hot, muggy day.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4241050"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/5e29b435-05f9-e5ae-860f-1a4d4504c895.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>My black bean tacos were also a success. I&#39;m getting very good at making tortillas. More excitingly, I realized they had tomatillos (albeit, canned) at my local Whole Foods, so I made some vibrant green salsa verde.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4241046"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/62264895-de0b-3706-796b-06d949eb2017.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>I did not succeed in finding (read: did not put in the effort to find) scotch bonnet chilis, however. Though the jerk chicken still has a nice floral kick from the habaneros that I did get my hands on.<br/>
<br/>
Looking to the week ahead, I&#39;m going to start with, yes, another <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/jun/19/baked-baby-aubergines-roast-okra-sweet-sour-peppers-yotam-ottolenghi-recipes-for-summer-vegetables"">Ottolenghi recipe</a> from the most recent Guardian column. Like Nigella Lawson, I&#39;m a huge fan of the anchovy. Pairing it with charred aubergine sounds like a great idea.<br/>
<br/>
More in-season, I&#39;m going to do a pasta with mussels or, if you have friends you want to impress, <a href=""https://www.onthestovetop.com/linguine-alle-cozze/"">linguine alle cozze</a>. I had dreams of making this outdoors on Lake Annecy, but alas I wasn&#39;t willing to take the risk proving I&#39;m vaccinated to the French border police. With that I&#39;ll do some sort of chunky salad. Maybe something as simple as last-of-the-season asparagus with a vinaigrette.<br/>
<br/>
Keeping with the summery feel, despite not having an outdoor cooking space, I&#39;m in the mood for something burger-y. I&#39;m thinking of something like these <a href=""https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/chickpea-mushroom-burgers"">chickpea-mushroom burgers</a>, since, technically, the eggplant is not veggie. I made way too much Vietnamese-style pickled carrots; they might make a good topping. With that, probably some sweet potato fries.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m keeping my hopes up the first of the overpriced but delicious summer berries will make their appearance when I go shopping this week. Barring that, it&#39;s back to a meringue to use up my carton of egg whites.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m getting melancholic! This has been a fun part of the last year and change. Again, I&#39;ll say more next week in the final issue. As a reminder, if you&#39;d like to keep hearing from me in a similar format, sign up for the <a href=""https://mailchi.mp/df15b737a1e9/josephs-recipe-log"">new newsletter</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Until next week, for the last time,<br/>

"Confinement Cooking, The End","Hello readers,<br/>
<br/>
This is the last one! It&#39;s been fun, but it&#39;s also time. Putting this together every week is a surprisingly big challenge. I don&#39;t want to flake out when, as is increasingly happening, I actually have plans and something to do on weekends.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4248018"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/d0d30a89-768b-5e3c-8308-b53276f4182a.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>But that&#39;s not to say the adventure is over. If you haven&#39;t already, please sign up for my <a href=""https://mailchi.mp/df15b737a1e9/josephs-recipe-log"">new newsletter</a>! I&#39;m planning to send something out once a month with musings and observations in the same vein as this. Without compromising my security posture, the first edition should have some content that hasn&#39;t been possible for the last year and change. Not to mention, at some point my <a href=""https://jkibe.github.io/kitchen145/"">kitchen renovation</a> will happen, and I&#39;m sure that will be quite a journey. It&#39;s been so long, I may actually be able to follow through on my original plan and invite myself to people&#39;s homes to cook while I&#39;m living on a construction site.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4248014"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/0b2e1667-c88f-206c-17dd-3ebee0d9b6d3.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>That will feed off my <a href=""https://therecipelog.com"">latest foray into online publishing</a>, continuing my inadvertent path to mastering online marketing tools. If you&#39;ve ever wondered what I actually made when I referenced something in this newsletter, my recipe log has it. Or at least it increasingly does as I slowly migrate more from paper into my Git repository.<br/>
<br/>
Before a last week-in-food inventory, a quick pandemic-in-food inventory in this last edition. Three to be precise. It&#39;s been a difficult year, but as usual a major perturbation also <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsGeThfejqA"">forces us to find places</a> we hadn&#39;t thought to change.<br/>
<br/>
First, having to write something every week &mdash; and thus live up to people&#39;s expectations &mdash; really helped push me out of ruts. Having to dig deep and try new recipes has been really useful. I&#39;d never have tried making a biryani or some of the more exotic Ottolenghi dishes without &quot;needing&quot; to for these purposes. Fortunately, having realized it&#39;s actually not that much work to expand my repertoire, I&#39;m hoping it won&#39;t take exposing my food habits to the world to push me to be a little more adventurous.<br/>
<br/>
Second, it&#39;s nice not to go shopping for food multiple times a week. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll be quite as fastidious as I was when it was a public health necessity. Even so, it&#39;s a nice convenience, only made possible with a bit more planning than I did pre-pandemic. Meal planning is here to stay.<br/>
<br/>
Third, ordering ahead online is great. Even before the pandemic, I would force myself to go out and buy something for lunch if I was working from home. But until it was a necessity, I thought there was something too impersonal and clunky about ordering ahead for pickup. Now, I&#39;m a convert. It&#39;s so nice to walk in and have food prepared with your name on it, as if by magic. No waiting around. No misspelled names. Granted, I do find the process clunky. Only my three favorites have made the cut.<br/>
<br/>
Not a great year, to say the least. But having an outlet to channel at least some of my nervous creativity has been nice. I&#39;m sure there will be more lessons we learn from this experience.<br/>
<br/>
Last but not least, a few notes from this last week in food.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4248010"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/94dbff33-f77f-839d-ed0c-9315f0166ee0.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>Miraculously, they had bewitchingly fragrant local strawberries for the first time of the season. Were they overpriced? Yes. Were they delicious? Very.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4247994"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/d7f4c87c-aec9-996a-00ef-fc12e97acdd7.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>I had a few leftover scallops in the freezer, so I dressed up the pasta for an extra deluxe finish. I also took the trick from the garlicky shrimp of a few weeks ago to boost the garlic and chili flavor. I finally got the heat level just right: enough it adds a nice kick, not so much it was painful.<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4248006"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/53d0cc77-5c0b-18a8-1fa2-5515e9f6478f.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>The Ottolenghi eggplant was disappointing, possibly more due to my incompetence than anything about the recipe. Namely, I didn&#39;t realize my tub of yoghurt was way out of date (not typical and not edible), and that I had run out of anchovies, the real tragedy.<br/>
<img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4248002"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/251d0785-1df4-f6a5-f63d-f8516bb2c50c.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/><img class=""tl-email-image"" data-id=""4247998"" height=""425"" src=""https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/4f1e14b58e6447e2783cf4c6f64e99de3f16e046/images/aeaaf1de-ccdd-ce50-a01b-49c683556b70.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; max-width: 640px;"" width=""640""/>The burgers were more unremarkable and much less photogenic. Suffice to say I undercooked the chickpeas slightly and the &quot;burgers&quot; weren&#39;t quite as well-bound as I would have hoped. Room to improve, I&#39;d say.<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s it! I may send out another reminder to sign up for the <a href=""https://mailchi.mp/df15b737a1e9/josephs-recipe-log"">new newsletter</a> in a few weeks, depending on numbers. Otherwise, stayed tuned there for what comes next. I&#39;m hoping to have something to say by the middle of July.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading,<br/>

"One Last Time","Hello again,<br/>
<br/>
I know the last edition of this was supposed to be the last-last. I also know that it often takes more than one reminder for people to take action. One last reminder, then: if you&#39;d like to keep getting something from me in your inbox every once in a while &mdash; I&#39;m aiming for once a month &mdash; you should <a href=""https://mailchi.mp/df15b737a1e9/josephs-recipe-log"">subscribe to my new newsletter</a>!<br/>
<br/>
<span style=""caret-color: rgb(85, 85, 85); color: rgb(85, 85, 85); font-size: 16px; font-style: normal;"">It&#39;s been surprising how many people were disappointed not to be getting an email from me every week. From my perspective, I hit a button on my computer every Sunday and then took it on faith that people saw and maybe enjoyed what I wrote.</span><br/>
<br/>
For the try-before-you-buy crowd, I published the <a href=""https://us6.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=eea7dd3bdd4eb0009b08a1e8c&id=49fbaa504b"">first edition</a>&nbsp;a few weeks ago. The format is still evolving. I&#39;m trying to keep a similar format to this, but with a looser deadline and longer timescale now that I actually leave the house.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, this really is it. It&#39;s been a fun pandemic project.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for reading,<br/>
