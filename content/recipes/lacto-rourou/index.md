Like many of the best ideas, this one was born out of a need to clear out my refrigerator. I had a print container with a bunch of leftover fermentation medium from a batch of lacto-fermented strawberries, and I needed to use it up.

Then I was reading up on the history and science of pastis, and the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastis) had links to cocktails with pastis as a base. The rourou sounded fun just on the basis of its name, and, as a happy coincidence, it used strawberry syrup.

### Ingredients

* 25 mL pastis
* 10 mL reserved strawberry lacto-fermentation medium
* Water, cold

### Method

In a chilled glass, stir together the pastis and strawberry lacto-fermentation medium. Then add water to taste.
