From a [Rick Bayless recipe](https://www.rickbayless.com/recipe/roasted-cauliflower-tacos-with-poblano-chile-and-caramelized-onion/).

### Ingredients

* Olive oil
* 1 cauliflower, cut into bite-size pieces
* 1 onion, thinly sliced
* 2 poblano peppers, 1 cm dice
* 100 g crème fraîche
* Salt
* Handful cilantro, roughly chopped
* Corn tortillas

### Method

Preheat an oven to 200 °C (400 °F).

In a bowl, combine the cauliflower with a generous amount of olive oil and salt to taste. Toss the mixture to coat the cauliflower. Lay the cauliflower on a baking tray in a single layer. Roast the cauliflower in the oven until it's nicely browned, about 20 minutes, tossing halfway through.

Meanwhile, in a frying pan over medium heat, warm up a film of olive oil. Then add the onion and peppers with a pinch of salt. Cook those until they're soft and just beginning to brown at the edges. Remove them from the heat while the cauliflower finishes roasting.

Pour the roasted cauliflower into the onion-poblano mix. Place the pan back on low heat and add the crème fraîche, tossing to coat the mixture in the cream. Season to taste and serve in warm corn tortillas with cilantro.
