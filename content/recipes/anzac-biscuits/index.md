### Ingredients

* 150 g all-purpose flour
* 90 g desiccated coconut
* 90 g rolled oats
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* Pinch salt
* 150 g unsalted butter
* 160 g brown sugar
* 90 g golden syrup

### Method

In a large bowl, combine the flour, coconut, oats, baking soda, and salt. Roughly whisk the mixture together.

Combine the butter, sugar, and golden syrup in a small saucepan. Heat the butter and sugars over medium heat to melt the butter, and then whisk the mixture together.

Pour the sugar-butter mixture over the dry ingredients and stir the mixture to combine everything together. Cover the bowl and refrigerate the dough to firm up for around 30 minutes.

Preheat an oven to 160 °C (325 °F).

Line two baking trays with Silpats or parchment paper. From the dough into roughly 30 g portions, rolling each portion into a small ball and then gently flattening it as it's placed on the tray.

Bake the biscuits for around 12-15 minutes, until they're lightly browned.

Let them cool on the baking tray for 10-15 minutes before transferring them to a cooling rack.

Store them in an airtight container for up to a week.
