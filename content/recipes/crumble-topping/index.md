A crumble is about the easiest dessert it's possible to make. Get good fruit, toss it in a bit of sugar to taste, add some cornflour to thicken, and then cover with this topping.

It's so easy, I haven't really felt the need to write the recipe for the actual crumble. For anyone else reading this, bake at around 220 °C (425 °F) for about 20 minutes. You're looking for the fruit to bubble and the topping to brown nicely.

While any flour will work, I like what's sold in the US as "white whole wheat". There is no magic: it's less refined than all-purpose flour. But it's still considerably more refined than whole wheat, so it doesn't overwhelm the butter and sugar. This is a dessert after all.

### Ingredients

* 100 g flour
* 20 g sugar
* 5 g baking powder
* 50 g butter, cold, cubed

### Method

Roughly stir together the flour, sugar, and baking powder. Then add the butter. Rub the butter into the dry ingredients with your hands until the mixture is sandy, but still has some uneven chunks.

For a bigger batch that's been scaled up, use the paddle attachement of a stand mixer.
