This is based on a recipe due to Stella Parks with some modifications as I've adapated it to my own kitchen and preferences.

I usually have King Arthur white whole wheat flour on hand, which is what I use when I make these muffins. If you can't find that, a roughly 1:1 blend of all-purpose and whole wheat flour works well.

### Ingredients

* 340 g white whole wheat flour
* 150 g sugar
* 7 g ground cinnamon (1/4 ounce; 7g)
* 3 g ground ginger
* 3 g baking powder
* 3 g baking soda
* 2 g salt
* 1 g ground cloves
* Pinch grated nutmeg
* 170 g unsalted butter, softened (ca. 20 °C)
* 225 g pumpkin purée
* 110 g Greek yogurt
* 100 g (about 2 large) eggs, cold, cut into small cubes
* 15 g vanilla extract
* Pepitas

### Method

Combine all the dry ingredients in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted. Fit the mixer with its paddle attachment, and mix the dry ingredients until they're well combined. Then add the butter and mix the ingredients until the fat is well-incorporated, and the mixture is sandy.

Add the pumpkin, Greek yogurt, eggs, and vanilla, and then mix the ingredients on a low speed until everything is just combined.

Preheat an oven to 180 °C (350 °F) with fan (convection) if available.

Line 12-portion muffin tin with parchment liners, or grease the muffin tin.

Distribute the batter evenly among the cups. Sprinkle the muffin batter with pepitas.

Bake the muffins until they're lightly golden on the edges and a cake tester comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.
