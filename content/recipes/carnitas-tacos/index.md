While I understand that making corn tortillas from scratch is a bit of a pain, if you can summon the effort, that's really the detail that takes a taco from edible to amazing.

I feel a little bit ridiculous writing this as a "recipe." Really it's just an assemblage of different components. But if you're looking for a recipe for the whole package, here's mine.

In terms of portion sizes, I usually aim for tortillas about 15 cm (6") in diameter, and budget that people will eat about three tacos on average, assuming you're serving other dishes alongside.

### Ingredients

* Corn tortillas
* [Carnitas](/recipes/carnitas-sous-vide/)
* [Salsa verde mexicana](/recipes/salsa-verde-mexicana)
* Cilantro
* Radishes, very thinly sliced

### Method

Onto a corn tortilla, place a small quantity of carnitas. Then cover that with salsa verde, a generous bunch of cilantro, and three or four slices of radish.

Serve immediately.
