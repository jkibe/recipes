Take it from someone who learned the hard way: tomatillos are very much not green (under-ripe) tomatoes. They're a completely different product with a different flavor. Tomatillos also have a lot more pectin than tomatoes, which gives this salsa nice body.

The jalapeno pepper is very optional. Adding it provides both heat and a nice note of floral complexity. For the hottest possible salsa, include it seeds and all. To get something with a little punch, but that's not completely overwhelming, de-seed the pepper.

### Ingredients

* 400 g tomatillos, de-husked and halved
* 3 medium poblano peppers, halved
* 1 clove garlic
* 1 onion, halved
* 1 jalapeno pepper, halved (optional)
* Neutral oil (e.g., canola)
* Cilantro
* Salt

### Method

Preheat a broiler to high.

Arrange the halved tomatillos, poblanos, garlic, onion, and optional jalapeno pepper skin side up on a baking tray. Lightly drizzle everything with oil.

Broil the vegetables until they're black and blistered, 5 to 10 minutes.

Then remove the tray from the oven and immediately transfer everything to a large bowl, and cover the bowl. Let the vegetables steam and cool, about 15 minutes.

Peel away the blistered skin from all the vegetables. Discard the removed skins. Transfer everything to a blender along with cilantro to taste. Blend the salsa into a smooth pur√©e. Season to taste with salt.
