I snagged the basis for this recipe from a Jamie Olive food travel program. It caught my eye because it's a lot like a great cake I've had at a favorite restaurant. Though this adds pistachios, which are a nice flourish.

### Ingredients

#### For the sponge

* 250 g (about 5 large) eggs
* 225 g Greek yogurt
* 225 g granulated sugar
* 180 g olive oil
* Zest of 1 lemon
* Zest of 1 blood orange orange
* 75 g almond flour
* 150 g all-purpose flour
* 200 g semolina
* 4 g baking powder


200 g eggs
200 g yogurt
100 g sugar
150 g olive oil
zest lemon + orange
150 g semolina
100 g AP flour
50 g almond flour


#### For the topping

* 150 g pistachios, whole
* 150 g honey
* Juice of 1 lemon
* Juice of 1 blood orange

### Method

Start by making the sponge cake.

In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, yogurt, sugar, and olive oil. Then add the lemon and orange zest, and mix just to combine. Add the dry ingredients (almond flour, wheat flour, semolina, baking powder) and fold those into the wet mix.

Preheat an oven to 180 °C (350 °F) with fan (convection) if available. 

Lightly grease and flour a quarter sheet tray with olive oil.

Pour the cake mix into the prepared tray. Transfer it to the oven and let it bake until the cake is set --- a tester should come out clean, and the top should be smooth and matte --- about 30 minutes.

Remove the cake from the oven and let it cool in the tray on a wire rack.

Then prepare the syrup.

In a small saucepan over medium heat, lightly toast and then roughly crush the pistachios into a heterogeneous rubble. (A mixture of whole nuts plus large and small pieces is great.)

Then add the honey to warm it through. Reduce the heat to low and add the lemon and orange juice. Bring the mixture to a low simmer.

With something thin and sharp (e.g., a knife, a skewer) dot the surface of the sponge with small holes. Then pour over the pistachio mixture.

Leave everything to come back to room temperature, to let the syrup infuse into the sponge and the pistachios to set in place.
