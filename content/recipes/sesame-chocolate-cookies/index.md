These come from the excellent Mokonuts in Paris. Everything they do is delicious, these as much or more than everything else.

It can be a little difficult to find black sesame seeds. They're not really necessary for flavor purposes. As far as I can tell, they taste exactly like white sesame seeds. But I think it's worth hunting them down for visual interest. Also: yes, this requires an awful lot of sesame seeds.

It's also worth getting couverture chocolate rather than using chocolate chips. Chocolate chips will work, but because they have emulsifiers and are mass produced, the cookies don't have quite the same character. The chocolate isn't quite as gooey, and I love the different doses of chocolate with roughly chopped pieces rather than the uniformity of chips.

### Ingredients

* 230 g unsalted butter, room temperature
* 150 g sugar
* 100 g (about 2) egg
* 150 g rolled oats
* 250 g all-purpose flour
* 15 g baking powder
* 4 g salt
* 100 g black sesame seeds
* 100 g white sesame seeds
* 300 g dark chocolate, roughly chopped

### Method

Cream together the butter and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with its paddle attachment, on medium speed. It should be light, airy, and fluffy.

Then add the eggs and mix on low until just combined. Add the dry ingredients and then continue mixing on low until the dough is just combined and homogeneous.

Refrigerate the dough for at least 30 minutes, preferably overnight.

Portion the dough into roughly 40 g (about 1 cm diameter) balls. Place them on a lined baking tray. Gently press them down to slightly flatten them.

Bake them in a 180 °C (350 °F) oven until they're lightly browned along the edges, about 10 minutes. They should be fairly soft and will likely look under-baked. Cool them on a wire rack to room temperature before serving.
