This is another one of those recipes where I feel slightly ridiculous writing it down as a recipe. It's the kind of thing I'd throw together almost reflexively when the mood hits. But as this is at least in part 

Doing beans this way really highlights great product. I like to do this with heirloom beans from producers like [Rancho Gordo](http://ranchogordo.com). While you could make this with a can or jar of beans, I don't think it has the same impact. This is really a way to highlight good inputs more than anything.

Really any herbs will do here. This is great with leftover parsley, or works equally well with something like a mix of tarragon and chervil.

### Ingredients

* 250 g dried white beans
* Salt
* 30 g lemon juice (about the juice of one lemon)
* 3 cloves garlic
* 30 g olive oil
* Handful herbs, roughly chopped

### Method

Soak the beans overnight in a bowl of water.

Then, strain the beans and add them to a pot of lightly salted water. Bring the pot to a simmer, and let the beans cook until they're tender. This could take anywhere from 1 to 4 hours depending on the beans.

When the beans have reached the desired doneness, strain them and set them aside.

Now, make the vinaigrette. Put the lemon juice into a large mixing bowl, and then grate in the garlic using a rasp-style grater (e.g., a Microplane). Stir those two ingredients to combine. Then whisk in the olive oil. (Because there's no emulsifier, it really doesn't matter how quickly or slowly you add it.) Add the herbs, and whisk them in to combine.

Then add the still-warm beans to the mixing bowl and stir to coat.

Serve the beans hot, or let them cool and serve them lukewarm.
