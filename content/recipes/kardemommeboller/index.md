I've wanted to visit Denmark for years. Between other plans and (more recently) the global pandemic, I still haven't been. But I've learned the rudiments of the language, and thus discovered that the Danes love their buns.

These are really like a lighter, simpler hot cross bun: cardamom instead of all the fixings and no fighting with pastry bags to pipe on the crosses.

### Ingredients

125 g unsalted butter
250 g whole milk
7.5 g yeast
50 g (about 1) egg, beaten
500 g all-purpose flour
5 g ground cardamom
5 g salt
20 g light brown sugar

### Method

Melt the butter, then add the milk and heat to around 40 C

Add that to mixer bowl, add the yeast
Add the egg
Add dry ingredients

Mix with hook for ~8 minutes
Prove ~1 hour

Divide into 16

Prove 30 minutes

Brush with egg

Bake 200 C convection about 15 minutes
