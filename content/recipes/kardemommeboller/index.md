I've wanted to visit Denmark for years. Between other plans and (more recently) the global pandemic, I still haven't been. But I've learned the rudiments of the language, and thus discovered that the Danes love their buns.

These are really like a lighter, simpler hot cross bun: cardamom instead of all the fixings and no fighting with pastry bags to pipe on the crosses.

### Ingredients

125 g unsalted butter
250 g whole milk
50 g yeast
50 g (about 1) egg
500 g all-purpose flour
10 g ground cardamom
5 g salt


### Method
