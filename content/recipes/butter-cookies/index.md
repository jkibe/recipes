I won't take any credit for the original recipe here, but I really liked this modular approach to cookie making. It comes from the wonderful Honey & Co in London.

This version has a few more technical flourishes. It's also a way for me to record the variations that I do on the recipe.

### Ingredients

* 350 g unsalted butter, room temperature
* 150 g granulated sugar
* 50 g (about 1 large) eggs
* Pinch salt
* 500 g all-purpose flour

### Method

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with its paddle attachment, cream together the butter and sugar until it's light and fluffy.

Then add the eggs. Follow the eggs with the salt and flour.

Preheat an oven to 170 °C (340 °F).

### Variations

#### Vanilla almond thumbprints

Add to the dough:

* 10 g vanilla extract
* 80 g flaked almonds

Line two baking trays with Silpats or parchment paper.

Form the cookies into 30 g portions. Roll each portion into a ball, and, using your thumb, flatten each portion with a small indentation. The cookies do not spread much, and so can be packed quite densely on the tray.

Bake the cookies until they're lightly golden, about 30 minutes.
