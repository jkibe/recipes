I won't take any credit for the original recipe here, but I really liked this modular approach to cookie making. It comes from the wonderful Honey & Co in London.

This version has a few more technical flourishes. It's also a way for me to record the variations that I do on the recipe.

### Ingredients

* 350 g unsalted butter, room temperature
* 150 g granulated sugar
* 50 (about 1 large) eggs
* Pinch salt
* 500 g all-purpose flour

### Method

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with its paddle attachment, cream together the butter and sugar until it's light and fluffy.

Then add the eggs. Follow the eggs with the salt and flour.

Preheat an oven to 170 °C (340 °F).

Bake the cookies until they're golden brown. Time will vary depending on the shaping.
