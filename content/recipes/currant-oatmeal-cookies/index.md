While it may not stand up to logical scrutiny, I'm a big fan of dried currants and not so much a fan of raisins. Thus: the currant oatmeal cookie. A classic tuned to my whims.

We're victims to a lack of standardized flour classification in the US. I'm using King Arthur white whole wheat flour here, which is less refined than all-purpose flour, but much more refined than whole wheat. Another "white whole wheat" flour might work as a substitute; I make no promises.

### Ingredients

* 100 g unsalted butter, room temperature
* 120 g light brown sugar
* 80 g white sugar
* 5 g vanilla paste
* 50 g (about 1) egg
* 4 g salt
* 1 g ground cinnamon
* 1 g baking soda
* 120 g rolled oats
* 100 g white whole wheat flour
* 100 g dried currants

### Method

Preheat an oven to 180 °C (350 °F).

Combine the ingredients using the creaming method. In a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, beat together the butter and sugars until the mixture is very light and fluffy.

Then add the vanilla paste and egg, and mix again until the mixture is loosely combined.

Then add the remaining ingredients and mix on low until the mixture has just come together. Using a less refined flour makes this more forgiving than a dough made with all-purpose flour, but it's still a good idea not to over mix to avoid too much gluten formation.

Portion the dough into 30 g balls and place them onto baking trays lined with Silpats or parchment paper.

Place the trays of cookies in the preheated oven and bake them until they're just golden around the edges, about 10 to 15 minutes.

Store in an airtight container for up to three days.
