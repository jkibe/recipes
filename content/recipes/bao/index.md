There are innumerable ways to make bao, Chinese-style steamed buns. Eventually I'll fill this page with different suggestions for fillings and wrapping techniques. To start, the recipe for the dough.

### Ingredients

* 110 g water
* 10 g fresh yeast (5 g dry active)
* 10 g sugar
* 200 g all-purpose flour
* Sesame oil

### Method

In a large bowl, add the water followed by the yeast, sugar, and flour. Mix the dough until it's well-combined and forms a cohesive mass. Cover the bowl and let it sit for 15 minutes. Then, knead it for about five minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic. At this point, add sesame oil to taste and knead it into the dough.

Tightly cover the dough with plastic and leave it in the refrigerator at least two hours, up to overnight, to ferment.
