After doing some research, I learned that a _clafoutis_ is meant to be made with cherries. If you're using the same technique with other stone fruit, it's called a _flaugnarde_. The name comes from the Occitan word _fleunhe_ or _flaunhard_, meaning soft or duvet.

I like this: the batter is a soft sort of blanket that encases the fruit.

When I had the moment of inspiration to transcribe this I had some peaches I wanted to test out. As mentioned, though, this works well with other stone fruit like apricots or nectarines.

### Ingredients

* Butter
* Sugar
* 100 g (about 2) eggs
* 75 g granulated sugar
* 5 g vanilla extract
* 125 g whole milk
* 125 g heavy cream
* 30 g all-purpose flour
* 30 g corn flour
* 600 g stone fruit (e.g., peaches), cut into bite-size pieces
* Icing sugar

### Method

Preheat an oven to 180 °C (350 °F) with fan (convection) if available.

Lightly butter and sugar a medium-size (ca. 20 cm by 25 cm) baking dish.

In a bowl, whisk together the eggs and sugar until they're well-combined. Then whisk in the vanilla, milk, and cream. Then add the flours, mixing minimally until the batter is just combined.

Arrange the fruit in the baking dish, then pour over the batter.

Bake the flaugnarde until it's set and lightly golden, 20-30 minutes.

Let the flaugnarde cool, and serve it lukewarm.
