I came across these biscuits while I began learning the Danish language during the 2020 pandemic, and also wanted to immerse myself in the culture. These are wonderfully minimal. Not too difficult and delicious.

I've translated [this recipe from Alt](https://www.alt.dk/mad/opskrift/pebernodder-a-la-lagkagehuset), in Danish. At some point I'll convert the volumes to weights.

### Ingredients

* 250 g unsalted butter, room temperature
* 250 g sugar
* 1 dl cream
* 500 g all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon ground ginger
* 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1 teaspoon white pepper
* 1 teaspoon ground cardamom
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1 teaspoon baking soda

### Method

Cream together the butter and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer, using the paddle attachment on a medium speed. Then add the cream and continue mixing until the mixture is homogeneous.

Sift in the dry ingredients. Mix in the dry ingredients on low speed until the mixture is just combined.

Divide the dough into roughly four equal portions. Then roll those out into snakes about the thickness of a finger. Cut each of those into roughly 1 cm (1/2") pieces, and then arrange those into a single layer onto lined baking trays.

Bake them in a preheated 200 °C (400 °F) oven for about 8 minutes, or until they're lightly golden.

Cool the pebernødder on a wire rack to room temperature before serving.
