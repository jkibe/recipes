I dug this up for a party that demanded something green. It comes via Stoa, a bar in San Francisco.

When I do cocktails for a group, I like doing them in a batch. I also like precision and repeatability. So I decided to pre-dilute this with the addition of some water. (The original recipe has you pour this over ice to dilute it.)

This is enough to make 4 to 6 drinks depending on the exact size of the glasses.

The original calls for Chartreuse. That, it turns out, is very hard to find, and even when you can, it's incredibly expensive. I swapped in Faccia Brutto Centerbe in its place, and I thought it worked really well.

### Ingredients

* 240 g gin
* 80 g white vermouth
* 40 g Faccia Brutto Centerbe
* 65 g cold water

### Method

Stir everything together.
