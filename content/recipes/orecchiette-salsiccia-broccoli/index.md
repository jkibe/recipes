While you can of course use whatever pasta shape you like, I think the traditionalists have a good case that orecchiette works well here. I do think that mixing this up a bit with broccoli rabe --- leafier and more bitter than regular broccoli --- is a good idea.

Likewise, I think this works well with any pork sausage, but I've come to like the almost heretical choice of soft chorizo.

This is such a simple pasta that I usually make the sauce while the pasta cooks. If you're not feeling that confident about the timing, consider making the sauce, turning down the heat, and then making the pasta to finish it.

### Ingredients

* Olive oil
* 250 g broccoli rabe, roughly chopped
* 500 g sausage meat, removed from its casing
* 2 gloves garlic, thinly sliced
* 500 g dried orecchiette pasta
* Black pepper

### Method

Bring a pot of salted water to a boil.

In a separate frying pan, heat a thin film of olive oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat.

Drop the broccoli rabe into the boiling water, and blanch it briefly to soften it, 1 to 2 minutes. Strain it out, transfer it to a bowl, and reserve it.

Add the orecchiette to the boiling water and let it cook according to the package directions.

Meanwhile, add the sausage meat to the frying pan with the olive oil, and cook it until it's lightly browned, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon. Then add the garlic and let it fry just until it's fragrant, 30 to 60 seconds. Add the blanched broccoli rabe.

Emulsify and season the sauce with the starchy pasta cooking water.

Toss the cooked orecchiette in the sauce.

Serve it with a drizzle of olive oil and black pepper to taste.
