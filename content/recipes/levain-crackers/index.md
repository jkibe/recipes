This idea comes from the superb YouTube channel [Boulangerie Pas à pas](https://www.youtube.com/boulangeriepasapas). It's a great way to use what would otherwise get wasted when you need to refresh your levain but don't have the need to bake anything.

I'm suggesting some toppings for the crackers here. It's certainly open to creativity.

### Ingredients

* 100 g levain liquide discard
* Coarse sea salt (such as Maldon)
* Dried thyme leaves
* Parmesan cheese, finely grated

### Method

Preheat an oven to 200 °C (400 °F).

Line a baking tray with a Silpat or parchment. Spoon the levain into small rounds and then smooth the surface with wet fingers. Sprinkle over the salt, thyme leaves, and Parmesan. Bake the crackers for about 15 minutes, or until they're set and beginning to brown at the edges.
