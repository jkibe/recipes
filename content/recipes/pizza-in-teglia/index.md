Neapolitan pizza will probably always be my favorite, but if I'm honest, it's a bit of a pain to make at home. The dough really does need to be rested for at least a day, ideally more. For best results, you really need an oven that can achieve temperatures well in excess of what most home appliances can do. Even to do a passable job, you need special equipment like a baking steel.

Enter pizza _al taglio_. Literally "by the cut," more liberally translated, Roman-style pizza by the slice. This is a lot easier than Neapolitan-style pizza, and you can get great results at home without any special equipment.

It's basically a focaccia with pizza toppings, which is no bad thing.

This recipe is calibrated for a US quarter sheet pan (ca. 24 by 33 cm), and serves one to two people depending on appetites. It's super easy to scale up. Double it for a half sheet, or quadruple it for either a full sheet (if you've got a commercial oven for some reason) or two half sheets to serve a bigger group.

A crispy, focaccia-like bottom is a hallmark of pizza al taglio. If your oven lets you control it, I've found best results by only heating from the bottom element and putting the tray on the lowest rack.

### Ingredients

* 175 g water (ca. 30 °C)
* 2 g active dry yeast (or 4 g fresh baker's yeast)
* 20 g olive oil
* 250 g bread flour
* 25 g water (ca. 30 °C)
* 5 g salt
* Olive oil

### Method

In a large bowl, combine the water with the yeast. Gently mix the yeast into the water and let it bloom for 1-2 minutes. Then add the olive oil and flour. Mix the dough until it's well-mixed, but still rough, principally ensuring that there are no pockets of unincorporated flour.

Cover the bowl and let the dough rest for 30 minutes.

After the first rest, gently fold the dough onto itself, taking edges and folding them into the center of the dough. Re-cover the bowl, and let it rest for a further 30 minutes.

Now, make the brine, combining the second quantity of water with the salt and mixing to create a solution. Pour that into the rested dough, and gently fold the dough again to mix the brine into the dough.

Cover the bowl again, and refrigerate it for at least six hours, up to 36 hours, to ferment.

An hour before baking, take the dough out of the refrigerator.

Liberally cover the bottom of a baking tray with olive oil. Dump the dough into the tray and gently coax the dough out to completely cover the tray with the dough. If the dough is uncooperative and springs by, let it rest for 10 minutes to allow it to relax.

Preheat an oven to 250 °C (500 °F), without the fan (convection), engaging heat from the bottom only if possible.

Let the dough rest without any toppings for 20 minutes to puff up slightly.

#### With mozzarella and basil

##### Additional ingredients

* 400 g (14 ounce) can high-quality plum tomatoes
* Salt
* Thyme
* Mozzarella cheese, grated or cut into small cubes
* Fresh basil
* Olive oil

Make a quick tomato sauce by blending a the tomatoes into a rough purée.

Very gently spread a thin layer of the sauce onto the prepared dough. Then sprinkle the dough with salt to taste and the thyme. Distribute the cheese in an even layer.

Bake the pizza for about 

Let the pizza cool for 5-10 minutes, then remove it from the pan and cut it into slices. Finish the pizza with a few leaves of fresh basil and a drizzle of olive oil.
