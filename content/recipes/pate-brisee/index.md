While I don't totally understand the soft matter physics at work, this is easily the best and, importantly, easiest tart base to work with.

This is an unsweetened shortcrust pastry. That tends to lend it to savory tarts, but it can also work for a very sweet filling.

### Ingredients

* 140 g all-purpose flour
* 225 g unsalted butter, cold, cut into small cubes
* 160 g all-purpose flour
* 3 g salt
* 60 g water, chilled

### Method

Fit a stand mixer with a paddle attachment. Then add the first dose (140 g) of flour, start the mixer on its lowest speed, and slowly add the butter. Mix the flour-butter mixture until the butter and flour are completely combined. Add the second dose (160 g) of flour, and continue mixing until the mixture takes on a rough, sandy texture.

Then add the water and mix the dough until it's just combined.

Divide the dough in half, and press each of them into a disc about 2 cm (1") thick and with a 15 cm diameter (6"). Wrap the discs in plastic and refrigerate the dough for at least an hour, up to 24 hours.

For longer-term storage, either use a second layer of plastic and a freezer zip-top bag, or vacuum pack and freeze.
