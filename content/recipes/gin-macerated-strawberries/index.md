My moment of discovery with alcohol and desserts came one of the first times I went to the [River Cafe](https://rivercafe.co.uk) and ordered the panna cotta. At the time, they were serving it with raspberries and a healthy dose of grappa poured over the plate. It wasn't much --- certainly not enough to really affect anything --- but that boozy note was really nice.

I've taken that idea and crossed it with a Pimm's cup, usually made with gin and strawberries.

Adding gin to the macerating liquid is akin to adding miso to a peanut butter cookie. The hint of alcohol comes through, but I doubt anyone would know it's gin specifically as much as the strawberries taste even better than usual.

While I suppose it's possible to make this with any strawberries, I reserve this treatment for the brief window in the summer when I can get my hands on really good local strawberries.

### Ingredients

* 250 g strawberries, halved and hulled
* 30 g sugar
* 30 g gin

### Method

In a medium bowl, toss the strawberries with the sugar and gin. Let the mixture infuse for at least an hour. Serve immediately.
