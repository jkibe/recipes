This is a simple, excellent way to prepare cauliflower. I claim no credit: it was made famous by Café Miznon. They have locations all around the world; I learned about it [via Le Fooding](https://lefooding.com/en/recipes-video-toquera/toquera-295-an-affair-with-un-chou-fleur).

At home, I've found it easier to split the cauliflower in half for the boiling step. Even my biggest stockpot is a bit too small to completely contain the cauliflower that I buy.

### Ingredients

* 1 whole cauliflower
* Olive oil
* Sea salt

### Method

Bring a very large pot of water to a rolling boil over high heat. Generously salt the water. Then boil the cauliflower until it's almost falling apart and offers no resistance to a skewer or paring knife.

Let the cauliflower cool and the surface to dry out for at least 15 minutes, up to a couple of hours. Rub a generous quantity of olive oil into the cauliflower.

Bake the cauliflower in a preheated 250 °C (500 °F) oven until the surface is deeply browned and charred in places. Finish with sea salt for texture.
