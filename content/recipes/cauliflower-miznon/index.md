I take inspiration here from the people at Café Miznon, now with locations all over the world. Though I learned about it [via Le Fooding](https://lefooding.com/en/recipes-video-toquera/toquera-295-an-affair-with-un-chou-fleur), and their old Toquéra series.

The original recipe suggests boiling the whole head of cauliflower in salty boiling water. Admittedly this has the advantage of doing a really good job of seasoning the cauliflower. But it also has some disadvantages. Or perhaps one very big disadvantage singular. Namely: you need a huge pot of boiling water. One big enough to accommodate a whole cauliflower with some headroom. This is both cumbersome and very resource-hungry. Keeping all that water at a boil uses a ton of energy.

At some stage, I realized there's a simple workaround. Water in the form of steam can get a lot hotter than water in its liquid state, and keeping a relatively small amount of steam going is both less cumbersome and a lot more energy efficient. It does mean being a little more generous with the salt for good seasoning.

### Ingredients

* 1 whole cauliflower
* Olive oil
* Sea salt

### Method

Fill a large stock pot (large enough to fit the entire cauliflower) with 3-4 cm (1-2") of water. Bring the water to a rolling boil. Add the cauliflower, cover the pot, and steam the cauliflower until it's very well cooked. A knife should easily go through it.

Let the cauliflower cool and the surface to dry out for at least 15 minutes, up to a couple of hours. Rub a generous quantity of olive oil into the cauliflower and season to taste.

Bake the cauliflower in a preheated 250 °C (500 °F) oven until the surface is deeply browned and charred in places. Finish with sea salt for texture.
