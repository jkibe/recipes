This was a 2020 lockdown favorite of mine. It [comes from the late Taku Sekine](https://www.instagram.com/p/B_edxtSpg3q/) of Dersou and Cheval d'Or, two excellent restaurants in Paris. This makes one portion, though it's easy enough to scale up. I would recommend doing individual filets, however, rather than treating an enitre side of salmon as one piece.

### Ingredients

* 60 g white miso
* 30 g dry white wine or sake
* 15 g sugar
* 150 g filet salmon

### Method

In a small bowl, whisk together the miso, wine, and sugar to make a smooth homogeneous marinade. Then submerge the fish in the marinade. Let the fish marinate for around two hours.

Preheat the broiler of an oven to its highest setting. Place the marinated fish on a broiling tray, and then cook the fish until it's lightly browned and firm. Serve the fish immediately.
