After doing some research, I decided to use [this recipe](https://nishkitchen.com/korma-paste/) from Nish Kitchen as a starting point.

For the current version, I made some changes (i.e., omitted or substituted ingredients) based on what I had on hand.

### Ingredients

* 1 teaspoon cumin
* 2 teaspoons garam masala
* 1 teaspoon Aleppo pepper
* 20 g cashews
* 3 cloves garlic, crushed
* 30 g canola oil
* 15 g tomato paste
* 4 cm ginger, peeled
* Handful cilantro

### Method

Combine all the ingredients in a tall narrow container. Blend into a smooth paste with a hand blender.
