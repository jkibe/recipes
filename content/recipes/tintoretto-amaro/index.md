I had this at one of those great restaurants that reinvents its menu every day. They usually have one or two house cocktails on, and this one was particularly great.

It's been long enough that my memory of the original is hazy. But I liked it enough I wrote down the ingredients, and then the unmodified tintoretto is a standard prosecco-pomegranate cocktail.

### Ingredients

* 100 g prosecco
* 50 g pomegranate juice
* 20 g blood orange juice
* 30 g Campari

### Method

Combine the prosecco, juices, and Campari with ice. Stir.
