I'm not even going to remotely pretend this is authentic in any way. This was an idea I had trying to rustle up dinner one evening in a kitchen other than my own, and I thought it was interesting enough to share.

I had some chicken thighs to cook, and nothing to add interest other than a well-stocked pantry.

### Ingredients

* 1 kg boneless skinless chicken thighs
* Olive oil
* Salt
*
