Unfortunately, we haven't gotten our act together and settled on standards for flour types in the US. I'm using King Arthur white whole wheat flour here. If you can't (or don't want to) hunt that down, I'd recommend substituting a roughly 1:3 ratio of whole wheat to all-purpose flour. 

### Ingredients

* 210 g white whole wheat flour
* 50 g rolled oats
* 20 g sugar
* 20 g baking powder
* 2 g salt
* 80 g unsalted butter, cold, cut into small cubes
* 20 g eggs
* 100 g whole milk
* 60 g dried currants
* Egg, beaten

### Method

Combine the dry ingredients in the bowl of a stand mixer. Fit the mixer with its paddle attachment and, on low speed, mix the dry ingredients until they're well-combined and homogeneous. Then add the butter and mix it on low speed until the mixture is sandy, but still has a somewhat uneven texture.

Then add the eggs, milk, and currants. Mix on low speed until just combined. Divide the dough into four large or eight small cakes, rolling them into a round and then gently flattening. Brush the formed scones generously with the beaten egg.

Bake in a preheated 180 °C (350 °F) oven for about 20 minutes until the edges of the scones are lightly browned.
