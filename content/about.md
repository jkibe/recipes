## What is this?

Somehow or another, I've come to really enjoy cooking and baking.

Through most of 2020 and 2021 as the coronavirus pandemic swept the world, I got into a nice rhythm doing meal planning and sharing it with the world through a newsletter. Especially in the first months, I had to eat at home, and I wanted to minimize grocery trips. As the pandemic began winding down, that became harder: I don't want to be that person who takes photos of everything at restaurants, or who shares my opinions of my friends' cooking online.

I thought about trying to write a cookbook, but instead I've settled on setting up my second attempt at a food blog. I'm hoping the lessons I learned through my pandemic newsletter experience will translate into something more successful than my first try at this.

### Why online?

While I still think it would be fun to publish a cookbook one day, as I was thinking about it, the online medium really is great. It can always change, adapt, and be updated as I learn more, or my tastes change. It also means I don't have to be confined to recipes, and can perhaps mix in other content that's more timely.

## Quirks and foibles

### On the metric system

You'll probably notice that my default is to metric units, despite being in the US.

While it definitely takes getting used to, it's really a much nicer way to work. The metric system is all base 10,  so it's a lot easier to scale recipes up and down. It's really complicated to double something like 2 pounds and 10 ounces. (It's 5 pounds and 4 ounces.) Whereas doubling even something as arbitrary as 541 g is easy. You just double the number.
