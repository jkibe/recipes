## What is this?

Somehow or another, I've come to really enjoy cooking and baking.

Through most of 2020 and 2021 as the coronavirus pandemic swept the world, I got into a nice rhythm doing meal planning and sharing it with the world through a newsletter. Especially in the first months, I had to eat at home, and I wanted to minimize grocery trips. As the pandemic began winding down, that became harder: I don't want to be that person who takes photos of everything at restaurants, or who shares my opinions of my friends' cooking online.

I thought about trying to write a cookbook, but instead I've settled on setting up my second attempt at a food blog. I'm hoping the lessons I learned through my pandemic newsletter experience will translate into something more successful than my first try at this.

### Why online?

While I still think it would be fun to publish a cookbook one day, as I was thinking about it, the online medium really is great. It can always change, adapt, and be updated as I learn more, or my tastes change. It also means I don't have to be confined to recipes, and can perhaps mix in other content that's more timely.

## Quirks and foibles

### On the metric system

You'll probably notice that my default is to metric units, despite being in the US.

While it definitely takes getting used to, it's really a much nicer way to work. The metric system is all base 10,  so it's a lot easier to scale recipes up and down. It's really complicated to double something like 2 pounds and 10 ounces. (It's 5 pounds and 4 ounces.) Whereas doubling even something as arbitrary as 541 g is easy. You just double the number.

## Equipment

### The Essentials

#### A Good Knife

There is nothing more dangerous or more frustrating than being in the kitchen without a good, sharp knife. Dull knives mean that you don't have control, and it's that, not the raw cutting power, that's dangerous. You also don't have to work as hard with a sharp knife, which will make prep that much more pleasant.

I honestly don't care enough about knives to have deeply opinionated recommendations. As long as it's sharp and a shape you find comfortable, it's a good knife.

The essentials to have on hand are:

* 8" chef knife
* 4" paring knife
* 10" serrated bread knife

Brands I'd recommend:

* Cut Brooklyn
* Kan Kitchen
* Shun
* Victorinox Fibrox
* Wüsthof

#### A Digital Scale

If cooking with bad knives is the most frustrating, then not having a kitchen scale is a very close second. Putting aside precision, they make cooking a lot easier. You don't have to hunt down the right size measuring scoop and then wash a dozen of them when you're done making a simple cake. With a scale, you can tare and then drop each ingreident into the same bowl.

Not that the precision doesn't matter at all. Especially with difficult ingredients, it can make a huge difference. No matter how hard you try, you'll never get consistent quantities of flour or brown sugar out of the bag with a measuring scoop.
